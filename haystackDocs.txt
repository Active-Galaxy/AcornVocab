you know, the dumas people sent us an email regarding the agenda moving forward and the timeline they proposed for the completion of the garden shaft. i think we were surprised by it. right. yep. as a new morning begins on oak island, brothers rick and marty lagina, along with their partner craig tester, have called an urgent meeting in the war room regarding the ongoing difficulties of deepening the garden shaft in the money pit area. the new timelines, of course, part of it is the issue with the weather. there\'s a lot of voids behind the shaft. there\'s all kinds of ancillary issues. 	S11E10.1
there\'s a lot of voids behind the shaft. there\'s all kinds of ancillary issues. it\'s a bit troubling. yeah. yeah, this is a disconcerting piece of news, right, craig, because, um, i mean, the garden shaft was probably one of the big things this year that we wanted to get done. but the bottom line is the date they now have for completion of just the deepening has moved way off into the fall. at least now we get to see where the water is coming from. source of the water. for the past three weeks, representatives from duma\'s contracting limited have been working tirelessly to halt a mysterious inflow of water into the structure, which has a current depth of 87 feet. 	S11E10.1
been working tirelessly to halt a mysterious inflow of water into the structure, which has a current depth of 87 feet. while the team is uncertain whether or not the water flow is associated with the legendary flood traps that have plagued treasure hunters in the money pit it has delayed their efforts to extend the garden shaft down to a final depth of some 95 feet. it is here where the team is on course to breach a seven foot high wooden tunnel. a tunnel that leads due west into the so-called baby blob, where high trace evidence of gold, silver, and other metals have been detected through water testing between depths of 80 and 120 feet. 	S11E10.1
trace evidence of gold, silver, and other metals have been detected through water testing between depths of 80 and 120 feet. now. rick, marty, craig, and the team must find another way to reach the valuables that they have all but proven to be buried deep in the money pit area. let\'s call up our partners and let\'s talk to them. hello guys. hey guys. welcome back to the war room. hello. hello marty. well, we\'re in receipt of your email, cameron and tony, you know, about the anticipated completion of the garden shaft and you know, clearly we\'re disappointed, but we have to deal with it and so we want to do damage control. 	S11E10.1
and you know, clearly we\'re disappointed, but we have to deal with it and so we want to do damage control. so that\'s point one. yeah, understood marty. you know, we have tried to mitigate, you know, that. that water ingress as much as possible, but it has delayed us from achieving where we\'d hoped to be at this point. right. so, you know, our focus has been on making sure that that shaft is sustainable moving forward. we would like to continue the work extending the shaft. we would like to go to 95 feet so we can absolutely determine whether or not it\'s original depositional work. 	S11E10.1
we would like to go to 95 feet so we can absolutely determine whether or not it\'s original depositional work. as of right now, we\'re not gonna deviate from that. yeah. we want to go deep enough to be able to put that drill down hole and go horizontal at those depths. and i guess the other question is, though, will the equipment that\'s going to be here be able to plug those wells after we\'re drilling without water issues continuing? yeah, so we\'ve got the manova fellas coming in, and they\'re going to give us a hand with a geofoam filling, and that\'ll fill the voids in behind the shaft and stabilize it again. 	S11E10.1
give us a hand with a geofoam filling, and that\'ll fill the voids in behind the shaft and stabilize it again. that\'ll be another week from now. ok. if dumas can safely extend the garden shaft into the tunnel below, the team can use a probe drill capable of reaching up to 40 feet outside of the structure to potentially pinpoint the location of the precious metals that have been detected. but first, representatives from dumas will utilize geofoam, an industrial-grade material that can expand up to 40 times its size to fill voids in the walls of the structure, which will stabilize the shaft and hopefully stop the current flooding. 	S11E10.1
size to fill voids in the walls of the structure, which will stabilize the shaft and hopefully stop the current flooding. it remains extremely important to be able to utilize the garden shaft for horizontal drilling. we want to find this treasure if it exists, and the garden shaft remains highly valuable in that exercise. if we can get the 40 plus feet out. we can find out what\'s outside in an 80 foot diameter circle. yeah, we\'re going to work together to solve the challenges, always. fair enough, love to hear it. okay, gentlemen, appreciate it. let\'s make a shaft. 	S11E10.1
fair enough, love to hear it. okay, gentlemen, appreciate it. let\'s make a shaft. thank you. take care guys, thank you. take care, bye bye. okay. all right, well, we are on the same page with those guys. so that\'s good. yeah, i think at this point, the possibility of doing the caisson work is looming large. but where? where? i would like to pump aladdin\'s cave, and if the metal\'s hold up, i\'d vote for that. you could maybe put a can over it. yeah. nearly 60 feet southwest of the garden shaft and the baby blob. the oak island team has also been investigating another spot in the money pit area where something of great value could be buried. 	S11E10.1
island team has also been investigating another spot in the money pit area where something of great value could be buried. a large cavern located some 150 feet deep that marty has dubbed aladdin\'s cave. due to the evidence of wooden structures and gold that has been detected there through water sample testing. who\'s that sitting right on the end of it? right there. it looks like a bolt. in addition, the team has obtained compelling sonar and underwater images inside of aladdin\'s cave, suggesting that it could be a man-made chamber. if they can recover definitive evidence that it contains treasure, the team has the option to dig a large diameter steel case on, as they have done in the past in the hopes of retrieving it. 	S11E10.1
to dig a large diameter steel case on, as they have done in the past in the hopes of retrieving it. i\'ve been a proponent of aladdin\'s cave ever since we found it, as saying this needs to be investigated. what is clear is we need to get a better image of the whole thing. so we need to drill another hole. we need to think about putting a caisson down into this thing. well, i mean, i\'m game for looking into caissons. i think it\'s a great idea. there\'s a lot of work to do there, so let\'s head on out. 	S11E10.1
i think it\'s a great idea. there\'s a lot of work to do there, so let\'s head on out. all right, ok. well said. later that afternoon. so bill, pull that back a little bit if you would. yep. in the southeast corner of the swamp, rick lagina, along with his nephew alex, gary drayton, and billy gerhardt continue searching for important clues near the potentially 500-year-old stone road. keep gary busy. since first uncovering this massive feature in 2020, the team has found critical clues nearby. such as ancient pieces of wooden barrels and a stone road, suggesting that it may have been used long ago to unload valuable cargo onto oak island. 	S11E10.1
barrels and a stone road, suggesting that it may have been used long ago to unload valuable cargo onto oak island. now, the team hopes to find more of the stone road and any valuable clues that may help solve the 229-year-old mystery. there\'s more chain. oh, look at that chain, yeah. more chain. good eye. yep, look. that\'s all connected. and this looks old. that does, yeah. yeah. this is definitely not factory-made. this is crude. hey, uncle rick. you might want to come look at this. seems like the larger one would be maybe to anchor that, and then the smaller ones would be for whatever you\'re doing. 	S11E10.1
like the larger one would be maybe to anchor that, and then the smaller ones would be for whatever you\'re doing. yeah. it\'s hard to tell because of all the crusty stuff. there you go, mate. if we\'re looking for signs of loading and unloading, you need some chains like this. wow. yeah, that\'s very cool. and you know what that reminds me of is a multi-point. you know what i mean? you have this ring and then you have your three points off of there, four points. that\'s what that is. you have a three-point hitch. it\'s going to be able to pull across even something like a beach. 	S11E10.1
it\'s a piece of wood. while excavating near the stone road in the southeast corner of the swamp, metal detection expert gary drayton, alex lagina, and billy gerhardt have just found a potentially important clue. yep. there\'s definitely some iron there. you can see it. iron oxide. yep. might be the top of the spike. i\'ll set this aside too. yeah, please. well, let\'s see what else we can get out. yeah. yeah, we\'ve still got another in here. that there might be. see if it\'s there. sick. you got some... oh, look! oh. that\'s the pointy end of the spike. 	S11E10.2
see if it\'s there. sick. you got some... oh, look! oh. that\'s the pointy end of the spike. look at the black spike in the wood. this is one of those old rose-head spikes. by the look at the top, that bevel on it. and that would make it pretty old, right? oh, yeah. yeah, this is old. yeah, a spike like that looks like it\'s from the 1700s or older. great. this actually might be a smaller ship spike, a wharf pin. this corner of the swamp is the one that just keeps on giving. yeah. it might indicate that it was part of a structure, right? 	S11E10.2
yeah. it might indicate that it was part of a structure, right? yeah, it\'ll help us with our database. yeah. an iron spike embedded in wood? could billy gerhart be correct that they offer evidence of a buried structure? before his passing in 2016, legendary oak island treasure hunter fred nolan reported to rick lagina that he had once found evidence of a dam feature in this same area, a dam that may have been used to artificially create the swamp. could the team have just found evidence of what fred believed is hidden beneath the south shore road? this is going to mean a lot to my uncle rick. 	S11E10.2
this is going to mean a lot to my uncle rick. so i want to see what we keep digging up. well, that was a heck of a dig, mate. we\'ve got a shitload of finds. we\'re going to be taking a lot of artifacts back to the lab. absolutely. yeah. all right, ready for the next scoop. ok. as operations continue in the swamp and in the money pit area. as we\'re all keenly aware, this structure in lot 5 has turned into a much bigger rectangular structure. yeah. rick has joined his brother marty, jack begley, archaeologist laird niven, and argue metallurgist emma culligan in the interpretive center. 	S11E10.2
rick has joined his brother marty, jack begley, archaeologist laird niven, and argue metallurgist emma culligan in the interpretive center. if it\'s literally as big as we think it is, then it\'s a big deal. yeah. it\'s a large structure. and we\'re starting to find more artifacts. emma and laird have conducted scientific analysis artifact as well as a carved stone that were found one week ago in the large foundation that was recently discovered below the circular stone depression on lot 5, located on the western side of the island. so this is what jamie called the carved stone. i have an idea of what it is. 	S11E10.2
so this is what jamie called the carved stone. i have an idea of what it is. so what is this? it\'s a whetstone. oh, is it a whetstone? yeah, for sharpening tools. i would expect knives. yeah? you can see the grooves, right? yeah. that\'s a technique that hasn\'t changed in forever. no, exactly. although the practice of sharpening tools dates back thousands of years, whetstones commonly made from sandstone or slate have been used since the first century ad. i would say that is the working side, but the real tell, i got emma to xrf it. okay, so you get to know composition? 	S11E10.2
okay, so you get to know composition? oh, even better than that. earlier this morning, emma analyzed the artifacts using two devices. an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer that uses x-rays to identify the elements that make up an object\'s composition, and the skyscan1273 ct scanner, which emits non-destructive radiation to penetrate built-up corrosion, revealing finer physical details. with the xrf, we can actually see the iron content where... they sharpened the... they scraped? yeah, they sharpened their tools or knives. that makes it basically definitive. yeah. this was a sharpening tool. exactly. okay, well, i am curious about the next one. jamie called this a decorative piece of iron. 	S11E10.2
exactly. okay, well, i am curious about the next one. jamie called this a decorative piece of iron. and she thought it was ornately decorating a box. yeah. and there might have been a design on it too. yeah. it looks like a crochet hook. ct scan does show us it used to be straight. oh, okay. so that\'s with its current iron state. so the red is the oxidized irons and the original iron remaining is actually this blue color. there\'s not a lot left. no. i don\'t see any decoration. we have singularly unique pieces on phone association with that feature, then we should compare that metallurgical analysis with others phone at the site. 	S11E10.2
unique pieces on phone association with that feature, then we should compare that metallurgical analysis with others phone at the site. let me just run a comparison real quick. but if it matches, that would be meaningful. it\'s aluminum to silicon ratio. it matches 17th century english. just looking at the spectra and the composition, i\'d say it\'s similar to phipps, just not 100%. i like that. so far this year, the team has unearthed several metal artifacts in the mysterious foundation on lot 5 that have been scientifically connected to the 17th century english politician and privateer, sir william phipps, a man who is believed by some. 	S11E10.2
been scientifically connected to the 17th century english politician and privateer, sir william phipps, a man who is believed by some. to have buried up to 50 tons of spanish silver and gold in the money pit back in 1687. you can see the two structural failures. could the team have found another critical clue to identify who constructed the mysterious feature on lot 5? if so, might that also explain the high trace evidence of precious metals that have been detected in the baby blob or in aladdin\'s cave? we have a match between metallurgy of items found on lot 5 feature with artifacts from the phipps residence in maine. 	S11E10.2
we have a match between metallurgy of items found on lot 5 feature with artifacts from the phipps residence in maine. you can\'t throw out this sir william phipps connection to oak island. i think it was buried for a reason. i think the key lies beneath the rocks at the very bottom. yeah. these things in front of us indicate it\'s important to keep going on. but in order to do that, we\'ve got to get out back. let\'s do it. all right. so laird, thank you. emma, thank you. thank you. see you. take care. let\'s do it. morning. 	S11E10.2
all right. so laird, thank you. emma, thank you. thank you. see you. take care. let\'s do it. morning. 15-ish more feet to go gentlemen and we\'re away to the races. all right. in the money pit area, alex lagina and other members of the team are overseeing the drilling of borehole kl-15 a borehole where they hope to breach a mysterious cavern known as aladdin\'s cave located some 150 feet below ground. this is the most unique feature we found underground in the money pit area. if we see something in there worth recovering, we\'ll get in it. this is gonna be 148. 	S11E10.2
if we see something in there worth recovering, we\'ll get in it. this is gonna be 148. 148? yeah, 24 run. well, i don\'t know. let\'s carve it up and have a look. that is bizarre. we seem to have a line of demarcation right here between this very, very fine material and that relatively coarse material, but we should have went into the open cavern. hey, mike, how you doing? not too good of news. uh-oh. really? yeah. so we didn\'t hit it, eh? we did. oh, you did hit it? yeah, probably about 147. what? yeah. and if you look at this stuff, it\'s like this is what\'s getting pulled into my case. 	S11E10.2
we don\'t have real good news regarding the cave. yeah. after being alerted of a potentially devastating development in the large cavern known as aladdin\'s cave in the money pit area. i guess the short explanation is there\'s reason to believe that the cavity may have collapsed. what? rick lagina has gathered members of the team in the war room to discuss the situation with marty lagina and craig tester, who join them. via video conference. so here\'s what happened. we drilled down to about 146-ish feet, and we got some infill. obviously, if it collapsed, the material had to come from somewhere. 	S11E10.3
obviously, if it collapsed, the material had to come from somewhere. i think that cave is important. so i\'d be disappointed if the whole roof fell in. yeah. plausible location for some sort of treasure would be in aladdin\'s cave because of the fact that there are. of precious metals dissolved in the water and high amounts of organic material, which indicate perhaps wood in the water. we\'re not going to give up on a latin\'s cave. it\'s possible it wasn\'t, like, a total collapse of the feature. maybe one of the walls gave way and there was a bit of a slump. 	S11E10.3
maybe one of the walls gave way and there was a bit of a slump. having said that, we have a lot of data, and i think we need to find a way to assimilate it all between the camera, the sonar... let\'s get a very competent understanding of what we have currently and then decide how to move forward. i agree with rick. let\'s get, i don\'t know, maybe paul and maybe steve to just look at all the data and see what we got. given what our current understanding of the cave is, if a collapse has happened or a partial collapse, then we need to understand it completely and figure out what we can do moving forward. 	S11E10.3
happened or a partial collapse, then we need to understand it completely and figure out what we can do moving forward. so it\'s imperative. gather all the information we have about aladdin\'s cave. and from there, we may be able to try to learn more about it. there\'s a bit of a bright spot, actually, which is that the other hole was one where we got another vantage point in the cave for the 3d sonar. and when we put the data together, maybe we\'ll be able to say exactly what\'s down there. we\'ll see. all right, guys. thanks for the update. 	S11E10.3
we\'ll see. all right, guys. thanks for the update. let\'s just see what the data suggests. yeah. all right. see you. talk to you later. bye. all right. later that afternoon. we\'re going to remove these stones. ideally, we want to see a nice wall. yeah. jack begley has joined archaeologist laird niven and other members of the team as they continue investigating the mysterious foundation located on lot 5 for not only more clues that might explain why it was built, but also to determine if it contains something of value. we still don\'t know exactly what this is. one way to find out. 	S11E10.3
we still don\'t know exactly what this is. one way to find out. well, let\'s keep digging and figure out what it is, yeah. while laird, jack, fiona, moja, and lindy clear soil and debris away from the stones to expose more of the structure, jamie and helen will sift the collected spoils for artifacts and clues. yeah, so laird, we\'ve got this piece of ceramic from up there. there\'s no glaze on it. there could be white salt glaze. i think it\'s stoneware. wait, it\'s just mid-16s to mid-17, hundreds. i like that. find the rest of the place. yeah, we\'ll do. 	S11E10.3
wait, it\'s just mid-16s to mid-17, hundreds. i like that. find the rest of the place. yeah, we\'ll do. thanks. we\'re finding a lot of evidence that this feature, it could well be related to william phipps, but why was it there? and the obvious connection would be with the money pit, if you accept the assumption that that was a large scale operation. i\'m hoping as we get deeper, we\'re going to find even more evidence to who built it. hey, jamie. so as i\'m in here, i\'m noticing that i\'m not finding any more rocks out here. so it almost looks like the wall, maybe it\'s ending here. 	S11E10.3
so it almost looks like the wall, maybe it\'s ending here. hey, laird. kind of getting interesting over here. if you look at the angle perpendicular to the possible wall there, it could be the entrance to a cellar, maybe. it could. it could be the staircase. that\'s interesting. a possible staircase? if it really does lead to yet another buried level of the mysterious structure, then just what might it contain? it\'s starting to look like something. i\'ll jump back in there. all righty. stone structures and features like that are really interesting for us because they can tell us a bigger picture story. 	S11E10.3
oh, wow. you have got to see this. isn\'t that gorgeous? oh, my goodness. oh, nice. while investigating a possible staircase that may lead to another hidden level of the stone structure on lot 5... oh, wow. that\'s really neat. ..archaeologist jamie kubba has just made a potentially important discovery. it\'s a gorgeous, decorated bead. what? what would that be made out of? glass. that\'s what it looks like. you think it\'s venetian glass? i don\'t know yet. what would be the telltale sign that it is venetian? size, technique, the chemistry. it\'s actually relatively rare. whoa. decorative glass beads have been traded among cultures, dating back thousands of years to the times of ancient egypt. 	S11E10.4
whoa. decorative glass beads have been traded among cultures, dating back thousands of years to the times of ancient egypt. however, in 1470 ad, glassmakers in venice, italy, developed a new technique for mass producing glass beads that became renowned throughout europe and asia, as they were not only used to adorn clothing and religious relics, but were also exchanged as a high valued form of currency. so we can get a rather definitive date off of this. that\'s what we\'re hoping. this is an important artifact. and i think it\'s gonna pull the date back. yeah. is it possible that the team has found a potentially 500-year-old venetian bead in the stone structure on lot 5? 	S11E10.4
is it possible that the team has found a potentially 500-year-old venetian bead in the stone structure on lot 5? if so, what is the answer? we\'ll find out in a minute. could it offer evidence that the feature is even older than the team previously thought possible? the surprising thing is the amount of different types of artifacts that are popping up. that means that this was a heavily occupied area for quite some time. so why has it remained hidden for so long? this is the first beam we\'ve found. i hope we find more. yeah, absolutely. that afternoon. 	S11E10.4
this is the first beam we\'ve found. i hope we find more. yeah, absolutely. that afternoon. i like the look of this material. in the southeast corner of the swamp, jack begley has joined metal detection expert gary drayton and billy gerhardt to continue searching for additional clues and evidence of buried structures near the massive stone road. very good. i think it\'s here. it\'s a little bit of some scrappy signal, but we\'ll see what we got. coming out. here it is. oh, wow! and we have got something really, really cool. yeah. look at the size of that. i believe that that is some kind of fastener. 	S11E10.4
yeah. look at the size of that. i believe that that is some kind of fastener. yeah. and that looks like it\'s raw iron. you know, we\'re talking 1700s or older with this. brilliant. a potentially ancient iron fastener? could it be related to the stone road, which may have once been part of a ship\'s wharf, or... could it be more evidence of the buried dam feature that fred nolan claimed to have found in this area more than three decades ago? i can\'t wait until it\'s cleaned up in the lab and we can see what it really is. 	S11E10.4
i can\'t wait until it\'s cleaned up in the lab and we can see what it really is. that is a beauty. come here, me little beauty. oh. all right, we\'ll bag it and keep scanning. sweet find, gary. morning craig and members of the team meet with blacksmithing expert carmen legg in the interpretive center to get his assessment of several artifacts that have been recovered this week near the stone road in the swamp. where would you like to start? this fastener that\'s inside the wood. i\'m looking at it and i see one, two handmade nails inserted alongside of the bigger item. 	S11E10.4
i\'m looking at it and i see one, two handmade nails inserted alongside of the bigger item. any idea on what it might have been used for, just based on that? a lot of times things were driven into walls where you needed to hang lanterns for light in tight spaces, like underground, to illuminate the space. could harmon lake be correct that this fastener may have been used to aid in the building of a structure in the southeast corner of the swamp? if so, could it be more evidence that the swamp  was artificially made as fred nolan believed? 	S11E10.4
if so, could it be more evidence that the swamp  was artificially made as fred nolan believed? it makes the next finds we\'re going to show you even more interesting. this is a big piece of iron. okay. this is not a spike. it\'s a tool. oh. so is it a chisel? what is it? no, it\'s called a set. it would be used to drive in pins to down flush or even countersink. yeah, yeah. might set planking in a ship, perhaps. in the timber construction of the ship? yes. on what date would you give something like this? 	S11E10.4
in the timber construction of the ship? yes. on what date would you give something like this? oh, i\'m going to say 16 to the late 1700s. there\'s always been the speculation that the ship foundered in the swamp and that it was covered up. so why were they there? and are there any artifacts at a greater depth? maybe craig, you can help me sort of straighten this out. okay. well, we\'ve got a big central link here, ring with three chains coming off of it. this hook is very old. and why is that? because the hooks made in the later time periods had a curve in the shape. 	S11E10.4
1650, and i would even go back to the 1500s on that. whoa. oh, wow. in the oak island interpretive center, blacksmithing expert carmen legg has just given his expert opinion that the large hook found one day ago in the southeast corner of the swamp could be more than 500 years old. the design or the stylistic? design and the way to the chain itself. from here to the ring is also the same time period as the hook. wow. now, each one of these links are handmade. however, the three chains on the end here are all machine-made. mm-hmm. 	S11E10.5
now, each one of these links are handmade. however, the three chains on the end here are all machine-made. mm-hmm. really? so basically what you\'re saying then, and this was cannibaled together, if you will, and an older piece was attached to a modern piece. what would, let\'s forget this chain, what would that have been used for? a set up like this with three chains fastened to a central link was used to lift or drag things. a lot of times they would hang from a boom to load a cargo onto a harbor, like a chest or a trunk. 	S11E10.5
of times they would hang from a boom to load a cargo onto a harbor, like a chest or a trunk. is it possible that the original use of this hook and at least part of the chain connected to it were used to move valuable cargo from a ship onto the stone road and then to somewhere on oak island? as much as five centuries ago. if so, who modified the chain at a later time? and was it repurposed in order to hide something else of value here as well? i think at this point, given the amount of artifacts that have been recovered at the swamp\'s edge that might be related to ship activities, there\'s reason to believe that there was an old wharf there. 	S11E10.5
the swamp\'s edge that might be related to ship activities, there\'s reason to believe that there was an old wharf there. so if you found such a structure, it had to be. closely associated with the original work. we may find more, and we may find something that help us connect the dots. carmen, we thank you very much for your insight, and you haven\'t heard the last of us. oh, very good. thank you. take care. see you, carmen. it\'s interesting. yeah, it is. later that afternoon. guys, this is gonna be really interesting. we\'re gonna talk about the fabled aladdin\'s cave. 	S11E10.5
later that afternoon. guys, this is gonna be really interesting. we\'re gonna talk about the fabled aladdin\'s cave. in the war room, rick... marty and craig have gathered members of the team for a follow-up meeting regarding the mysterious cavern located some 150 feet deep in the money pit area, known as aladdin\'s cave. these gentlemen have done a deep dive into it, and we eagerly await your findings. ok, so we did several sonar scans and video scans for this cave anomaly. we tagged into it in a couple of different boreholes. because the team fears that part of the cave may have collapsed earlier this week. 	S11E10.5
because the team fears that part of the cave may have collapsed earlier this week. paul troutman, surveyor steve guptill, and geoscientist dr. ian spooner have further processed all of the visual and water sampling data that was previously collected inside the feature in order to determine not only if it could be manmade, but also if it might contain something of great value. so i think i\'m gonna jump into the videos. on the left. is what we recorded on the right is prohawk\'s version. geez. the video files, which were originally recorded earlier this year, have been refined by prohawk technology group, a company that specializes in the enhancement of images that were originally captured in harsh or low-lit environments. 	S11E10.5
prohawk technology group, a company that specializes in the enhancement of images that were originally captured in harsh or low-lit environments. yeah, so this is what everybody noticed. the bolt. yeah. it\'s something that looked completely different from anything else we\'ve seen. well, there is a little flat area around it, too, which is different than the rest. oh. does that make more sense that it\'s human-made? why would a bolt be there? it could be stuck in a piece of wood like we find. so let\'s keep going. i think there\'s a feature that we want to see. there. we were looking for right angles. 	S11E10.5
i wonder if this is the opening that we\'re looking for. well, the flat surface in the corner, to me, could be potentially manmade. it might be. in the oak island war room, rick, marty, craig, and members of the team have just seen enhanced video evidence of a potentially manmade entrance connected to the large cavern known as aladdin\'s cave, located approximately 150 feet deep. in the money pit area. we do see some right angles. right angles generally don\'t exist in nature, but it could be partially collapsed. the magnitude of it is yet to be determined. there\'s more, right? 	S11E10.6
the magnitude of it is yet to be determined. there\'s more, right? there is. there you go. so this here is what we deem to be the possible opening, heading westward. and so i will show you the sonar, and it sort of confirms that. ok. so what you\'re looking at here, is a bird\'s-eye view of the cave. north is up, just for reference. mm-hmm. ok? so when we were westward, and you could see that opening. yeah. i\'m going to change some color here, too, and jump down. so the opening is right here. ok. the sonar images are quite beautiful, and it certainly suggested a possible way in. 	S11E10.6
ok. the sonar images are quite beautiful, and it certainly suggested a possible way in. that\'s important. if you can\'t get in, nothing can be in there. so when we look down at the cavity, we\'ve got a few different things to show. so from this point to this point is about 25 feet. north-south is about 15. and the deepest portion of the cavity, right here, is about 10 feet deep. ok. and you can see that the cave sits nicely at 150 feet. and you can see somewhat of an opening heading east, somewhat of an opening heading west. 	S11E10.6
and you can see somewhat of an opening heading east, somewhat of an opening heading west. right. perfect. ok, so ian, what does that tell you? to me, i see this connected to some man-made features, but the bottom line is, is it\'s collecting gold and silver values in that cavity and the wood. yeah. so either the wood\'s in there, or is it connected to a structure where wood is? right. and is that where the metals are coming from too? right. yeah. when you guys are ready, we\'ve got one more video. okey dokey. go for it. so last video, we\'re looking into the cave here, so we\'re just coming down into it. 	S11E10.6
go for it. so last video, we\'re looking into the cave here, so we\'re just coming down into it. so this is in the southern edge of the cave. there\'s a look at the floor. looks like it might be sort of collapsed around the debris all falling in. i\'d say this thing has collapsed over time. yeah. maybe it hides the evidence of what you\'re looking for, right? mm-hmm. i\'d really like to put a case on in that because i want to bring some of that material up and wash through it. because if there is bits of wood or anything in there, then it could lead on to more discoveries. 	S11E10.6
because if there is bits of wood or anything in there, then it could lead on to more discoveries. yeah, i agree with that. ok, let\'s do that. right. i would say so. you would? yeah. ok. aladdin\'s cave continues to provide tantalizing clues. the levels of metals and the levels of organics suggest strongly the presence of something there. the clues strongly suggest there\'s a reason to put a caisson in that area. we don\'t see what we hope to see, that being a man-made object. but a collapse would hide what could have been on the floor. i don\'t know when we\'re going to get back to it, but it is certainly on the list. 	S11E10.6
i don\'t know when we\'re going to get back to it, but it is certainly on the list. i think everybody in this room still believes that there\'s a very intriguing, compelling mystery here. and that is a good thing. all right, i think we\'re done here for today. good job, gentlemen. thank you very much. let\'s go. fair enough. at the end of another week on oak island, rick, marty, craig and their team are facing the most daunting challenges they have ever encountered in their quest to solve a 229 year old mystery. however, the clues and evidence of hidden valuables that they continue to unearth all across the island suggest that the answers they seek are well worth the pursuit. 	S11E10.6
morning. should say good morning, right? we\'re gonna find something today, right? well, we\'re pretty excited on this area. the closer we get to the stone road, the more exciting it\'s gonna get. as a new morning dawns on oak island for brothers rick and marty lagina and their team. the quest for answers to a 229 year old treasure mystery continues in one of the most intriguing and inhospitable locations on these 140 acres, the triangle-shaped swamp. gary, you\'re up. all right, mate, i\'m ready to get stuck in. hopefully it\'s not literally. this looks old. that does, yeah. yeah. 	S11E11.1
all right, mate, i\'m ready to get stuck in. hopefully it\'s not literally. this looks old. that does, yeah. yeah. one week ago, while excavating the potentially 500-year-old stone road or ship\'s warmth that was first uncovered in the southeast corner of the swamp  back in 2020, the team found a large hand-wrought chain and hook, which according to blacksmithing expert carmen leigh, was not only used to lift heavy cargo, but may also date back to the 16th century. i\'ll start down there to bottom and work my way back. okay. now the team is digging further into the southern shore that borders the swamp in the hopes of uncovering more of the stone road. 	S11E11.1
is digging further into the southern shore that borders the swamp in the hopes of uncovering more of the stone road. and also clues that could prove whether or not the swamp was artificially created in order to hide something of great value on oak island. stick there, mate? in the side of the hole? yeah. there, there. zach\'s cut. oh, yeah. that\'s worth banging. ok, i\'ll put it in the bag. ok. this is almost peaty, though. yeah, it does. it\'s a little bit of peat, and then it goes to a mud. and it\'s the only layer in here that\'s kind of like that. 	S11E11.1
and it\'s the only layer in here that\'s kind of like that. what it tells me is we need to know what\'s under this dirt. right. dr. spooner come down. yeah. all of a sudden, it attacks. yeah. the x-cut wood is interesting because it represents older type of wood construct. and this material is coming up in the peat. it\'s quite layered there. there\'s sand, peat, sand, peat. i would say that it\'s not natural. so what is going on here? hey, billy. hi. we don\'t know what to make of the possible connection between here and the stone road. 	S11E11.1
hey, billy. hi. we don\'t know what to make of the possible connection between here and the stone road. what do you make of peat, greaseproof sand? it\'s kind of... yeah, the peat shouldn\'t be over the sand. if this beach is moving landward with time, then the sand should be over the peat. i mean, this is, to me, really important because it tells us this feature extended out this way. so why doesn\'t that feature the way it exists there in front of our eyes, why doesn\'t that extend here? i think it was beach. they pulled the boat up on the beach, but you can\'t just have a big 26 foot boat sitting on a beach. 	S11E11.1
pulled the boat up on the beach, but you can\'t just have a big 26 foot boat sitting on a beach. you\'re trying to unload it. they needed a platform to haul it on. so i think they placed peaks over the sand and that\'s what it looks like to me. could dr. spooner be correct that the swamp and surrounding area was artificially manipulated in order to construct the stone road for the purpose of moving something of great value from a ship onto oak island. i think you need to go three, four feet. so i think we should go back. 	S11E11.1
i think you need to go three, four feet. so i think we should go back. yeah, yeah, okay. good. i think so. thank you. i hope there is something below here. i hope so, too. as the investigation of the stone road continues in the swamp. regina and craig tester arrive in the money pit area to meet with roger forte of dumas contracting limited. these are the guys that are going to help us get these voids filled in the shaft itself. along with ryan hooker and clint molino of minova global, a company that specializes in large underground construction operations. 	S11E11.1
along with ryan hooker and clint molino of minova global, a company that specializes in large underground construction operations. we got to get down to that 95 plus feet. and this is going to allow us to do it, you\'re pretty sure, right? absolutely. once we get this geofoam in place, i\'m very confident that we\'re going to get down there. okay. at least now we can see where the water is coming from. for the past four weeks, the 18th century, 87-foot deep structure known as the garden shaft has been continuously flooded after a number of voids formed just outside of the remodeled feature. 	S11E11.1
known as the garden shaft has been continuously flooded after a number of voids formed just outside of the remodeled feature. this has made rick, marty and craig wonder if the cause is related to one of the legendary man-made flood tunnels. because it has stopped them and dumas from extending the shaft down to a target depth of 95 feet, where a 7 foot high tunnel has been discovered. a tunnel which runs directly toward an area known as the baby blob. where numerous groundwater tests have yielded high-trace evidence of gold, silver, and other metals between depths of 80 and 120 feet. 	S11E11.1
where numerous groundwater tests have yielded high-trace evidence of gold, silver, and other metals between depths of 80 and 120 feet. okay, tell us what we\'re gonna do. well, we\'re gonna pump some foam in there and try to get your void filled up. all right, well this is just a pump, right? yep. ryan and clint will use an industrial-grade material known as geofoam, which is specifically designed... for use in mining and construction projects. once injected into the open cavities, it will expand to fill those voids, seal out the inflow of water, and stabilize the garden shaft so that dumas can extend it down into the possible treasure tunnel. 	S11E11.1
the inflow of water, and stabilize the garden shaft so that dumas can extend it down into the possible treasure tunnel. all right. well, gentlemen, good luck. we\'ll let you get to your work. pleasure to meet you guys. all right. thanks, guys. as the process begins in the garden shaft, just 60 feet to the southwest. so where are we? we are down 88 feet below grade. awesome. geologist terry matheson, oak island historian, charles markhouse, and alex lagina are supervising a new core drilling operation in a borehole known as k-6 a borehole that might actually be on track to encounter another potential cache of buried valuables some 180 feet deep near a site. 	S11E11.1
that might actually be on track to encounter another potential cache of buried valuables some 180 feet deep near a site. that the team previously investigated six years ago. okay, so k-6 drilling for the muon low density anomaly. exactly. also could be where the h-8 plug ended up. that\'s right. we\'re only about seven or eight feet away from the actual h-8 caisson, which makes it doubly interesting. so what we\'re seeing is a high density anomaly southwest of the garden shaft. it\'s significant. several weeks ago, representatives from ideon technology, utilizing a process known as muon tomography, presented the team with a subsurface scan of the money pit area that revealed numerous low density targets such as voids and possible buried containers. 	S11E11.1
a subsurface scan of the money pit area that revealed numerous low density targets such as voids and possible buried containers. one of the most compelling was identified at a depth of nearly 180 feet. come on baby, make home. it was in the same area where in 2017, the team excavated with a five-foot diameter steel caisson known as h-8 while they were attempting to locate the fabled chapel vault, a seven-foot high chest reportedly encountered by frederick blair and william chapel during a drilling operation in 1897 that uncovered trace evidence of gold, along bearing the letters, vi. after rick, marty, craig and the team discovered their own pieces of parchment and leather bookbinding in h-8 they were stunned when the caisson encountered a large object at a depth of 170 feet. 	S11E11.1
and leather bookbinding in h-8 they were stunned when the caisson encountered a large object at a depth of 170 feet. however, as the team extended the caisson deeper in the hopes of penetrating the object, the plot... or spoils inside of the caisson fell from the bottom and pushed the mysterious object deeper and somewhere off to the side. is it possible that the muon target that was detected at that same depth might be a void that now contains the missing plug from aj as well as the fabled chapel vault? i had a cobble there. at least they got, i think they got the cobble. 	S11E11.1
i had a cobble there. at least they got, i think they got the cobble. that\'s gonna be the 118. 118. we just pushed a rock for 20 feet. yeah, you can see him there, i believe. that\'s a core barrel blocker for sure. how often do we hit cobble around 100 feet? uh, i would say not very often. i\'m just wondering, the flood tunnel\'s description is uncribbed, stacked rocks, right? yeah. that\'s exactly the size of a rock you\'d put in a flood tunnel. well, that\'s interesting. yeah, very interesting. coming up. we are right at the end of the stone road mate, this should be good. 	S11E11.1
exactly the size of a rock you put in a flood tunnel. in my head it could be tunnel or something, right? yeah, you raise a pretty good point. in the money pit area, while drilling borehole k-6 where something of great value is potentially buried at a depth of approximately 170 feet, alex lagina and members of the team may have just made an important discovery at a depth of just 118 feet. i think it would at least be worth recording on this one, say, on your log. okay. just make a mark saying we hit a cobble at 118. 	S11E11.2
okay. just make a mark saying we hit a cobble at 118. okay. sure. because i\'m just wondering if maybe there\'s a pattern there. yeah. and that\'s actually an interesting premise. maybe we should look into that. yeah. as we\'re drilling, i\'m thinking... the stories of the flood tunnels are that they\'re full of stones, so we wouldn\'t have an open cavity if it was a flood tunnel. maybe we\'re actually pushing the topmost cobble through the flood tunnel, through the bottom. in 1897, the same year that frederick blair and his team encountered the so-called chapel vault, they also reported discovering a man-made flood tunnel, which halted their efforts at a depth of 111 feet. 	S11E11.2
so-called chapel vault, they also reported discovering a man-made flood tunnel, which halted their efforts at a depth of 111 feet. it was described as measuring nearly three feet wide by four feet high and was packed with large cobblestones. is it possible that the team has now also found evidence of a flood tunnel? if so, could that mean that they are on target to encounter what it was designed to protect? the flood tunnels were said to be full of stones, small stones, about the size of what we\'re seeing in the drill bit. the breaks don\'t seem to be very fresh or new. 	S11E11.2
the breaks don\'t seem to be very fresh or new. it could be evidence of deposit or activity. so this is all very, very interesting ground. we\'re going to cover it today. the most important thing is the move on target at depth. yeah, i agree. yeah. as operations continue in the money pit area on lot 5, located on the western side of the island. hey, laird. archaeological team, i\'m checking up on you. marty lagina joins lead archaeologist laird niven, jack begley, and other members of the team as they continue their investigation of a mysterious stone structure. so what is this? 	S11E11.2
so what is this? any more insight? this is definitely something going on. the soil is darker, it\'s looser, we\'ve got larger artifacts in it. here it\'s tighter packed, i feel like they\'ve been locked on a lot more. okay. the oak island team has discovered evidence on lot 5 that suggests that a number of secretive operations took place in this area long ago. for instance, near the middle of the lot, they have found a rectangular feature which helen sheldon believes was purposely buried, containing pottery and other artifacts, suggesting that it may date back to the same time period as the early 18th century garden shaft in the money pit area. 	S11E11.2
it may date back to the same time period as the early 18th century garden shaft in the money pit area. and near the shoreline, they are also investigating this circular depression that not only sits above a much larger foundation, but which has produced artifacts that have been dated to between the 14th and 18th centuries. okay, is there anything i can do for you, larry? yep. over here. what you got? where jack and fiona are. we need the rocks to go, including that big rock, if possible. and then we\'re expanding to the west, so we need half of the circle, those rocks taken out as well. 	S11E11.2
and then we\'re expanding to the west, so we need half of the circle, those rocks taken out as well. okay, i\'m gonna get the back of it. started as a circular depression is turning into a rectangular feature. the archaeologists themselves are quite amazed at what they\'re finding. let me nudge that one, jack. we\'ve always been looking for some sort of encampment. this is clearly very important. oh, that\'s got it, yeah. the investigation of the mysterious structure proceeds on lot 5. we are right at the end of the stone road, mate. this should be good. i know the archaeologists found a lot of pottery, but hardly any metals. 	S11E11.2
this should be good. i know the archaeologists found a lot of pottery, but hardly any metals. they\'re going to be here. ok. along the southern edge of the swamp, rick lagina, gary drake and billy gerhardt continue their efforts to uncover another section of the possibly 500 year old stone road. and hopefully valuable clues. i think that\'s the end of the road right there. because there\'s stacked rocks, right? that\'s what i would say. if that\'s the end of the road, though, then if you\'re transitioning from one form of transportation to another, this is where the stuff should be. 	S11E11.2
the road, though, then if you\'re transitioning from one form of transportation to another, this is where the stuff should be. yeah, exactly. i\'m going to go check that pile. signal right in the corner so that would have come out of that last screw. right rick dig that sucker up it\'s going to be an artifact. let it come from the road right? yep. i\'ll try pinpointing it and then grabbing it out of it. oh tiny whatever it is. and that bothered as long as it\'s old. let\'s see what we got. come on baby, be something good. i think it\'s that. 	S11E11.2
let\'s see what we got. come on baby, be something good. i think it\'s that. it is this. that is a lot of noise. for what looks like some kind of tack. that looks like it\'s either round or triangular shank. some kind of small fastener. i think it\'s too long for boots and too thin to be an ox shoe nail or an ore shoe nail, yet to be determined. that is definitely a candidate for the xrf machine. now you get... ah, it\'s gotta be something more than that. yeah, into the bag it goes. we\'ll get more. yeah. 	S11E11.2
gary drake and billy gerhardt have just unearthed several potentially important clues. oh, that\'s gorgeous. look at that. hopefully it\'s got some decoration, mate. if it\'s gonna be anywhere, it\'d be on that base. here\'s another one. ooh, that\'s a big chunk of pottery, isn\'t it? mm-hmm. some kind of bowl or dish. there\'s so much of it. maybe more. we should hand-dig this now. talk about finding something in situ as the archaeologists say. gorgeous, do you see any marks on any pieces? no, yeah, nope. look at that. what have you got, randall? look at that. that\'s nice. yeah, that\'s gorgeous. 	S11E11.3
no, yeah, nope. look at that. what have you got, randall? look at that. that\'s nice. yeah, that\'s gorgeous. look at that. someone would have had money. i tell you, mike, wherever there\'s milk, there\'s money. this is great. but the archaeologists can put that together and clean it up. maybe there\'s a maker\'s mark. yeah. if rick\'s hope that this pottery, which was found near the potentially 500-year-old stone road, might bear a maker\'s mark, proves to be true. could it help verify the revelations the team made two years ago and nearly 3,000 miles away? it should be just up here. 	S11E11.3
it should be just up here. in 2022, while visiting alcadao da serra in portugal, a town known to have been a stronghold for the portuguese sect of the knights templar between the 12th and 16th centuries. look at how beautifully constructed. rough and raw, but look at the curvature. look at the degree of slope remains constant. it\'s beautiful. rick, his nephews, alex and peter, as well as doug kroll, were shown a stone road that was nearly identical to the stone road in the swamp. if there is a portuguese connection to the construction of the road in the swamp, maybe this is the blueprint. 	S11E11.3
if there is a portuguese connection to the construction of the road in the swamp, maybe this is the blueprint. okay, now we gotta really keep our eyes peeled, right? could rick, gary, and billy? have just gotten one step closer to proving whether or not that potential connection is true. there\'s pottery there, greg. oh yeah, no mistake in that. what is it, rick? the thin stuff, i think. yeah, it\'s the thin stuff, and this looks like it\'s a plate. that\'s a plate rim by the look of it. it\'s gotta be some makers max on some of this stuff. 	S11E11.3
that\'s a plate rim by the look of it. it\'s gotta be some makers max on some of this stuff. good eye, mate. check this out. oh, it\'s coming up. look at that. that\'s a beautiful piece of pottery. that could be old. yeah, this could be old, mate. that is really, really fancy. almost like a leaf design on it. i haven\'t seen that before, so that makes it interesting. here you go. another one. excellent work. oh, man, that\'s sweet, isn\'t it? mm-hmm. yet glazed on one side. it\'s got a bit... this is lovely, mate. good eye. that\'s some sweet pottery. 	S11E11.3
mm-hmm. yet glazed on one side. it\'s got a bit... this is lovely, mate. good eye. that\'s some sweet pottery. and i believe that this pottery is older than that dish or a bowl we found. yep, i agree. i think the pottery\'s getting older, the deeper we\'re going. yep. we found a number of different types of pottery. one or two vessels where they could possibly be reconstructed. and it was quite localized. nice finds, rick. but what does that say? perhaps laird can make sense of it. i know we\'re running out of daylight, mate, but we\'ve got to come back and dig some more, because there really could be anything anywhere in this sand. 	S11E11.3
mate, but we\'ve got to come back and dig some more, because there really could be anything anywhere in this sand. well, then what you need to do is ask billy if we want to keep digging. guess what his answer is going to be. yeah. hell yeah. yeah. following morning. i don\'t think we have to go any deeper do you? take that little square out of there. as rick leads the efforts in the swamp. so it is expanding and filling that void up. that\'s great. that\'s what we want to see. absolutely. and while the geofoam application proceeds in the garden shaft. 	S11E11.3
that\'s great. that\'s what we want to see. absolutely. and while the geofoam application proceeds in the garden shaft. oh there she goes. there she goes. hey charles, terry. hey, how you doing alex? i hear we\'re close to target depth. we are. yeah. alex lagina returns to the money pit area. lovely. to check on the core drilling operation in borehole k-6 a borehole which the team hopes will encounter man-made workings or valuables between the depths of 170 and 180 feet. they haven\'t brought anything up for quite a while. we\'ve got to cross our fingers to still be it. 	S11E11.3
board at 183. all right, so let\'s see what we got. it is a potentially important moment in the money pit area for members of the oak island team. here we go. we\'re looking for something that slipped out of the h-8 case on. that could be it right there. after encountering a void in borehole k-6 at a depth of 183 feet, where a highly specialized muon tomography scan identified possible man-made workings earlier this year. thank you, mike. no prob. let\'s carve this bad boy out and see what we got here, gentlemen. they are examining a freshly unearthed core sample that will hopefully reveal clues as to what the void contains. 	S11E11.4
they are examining a freshly unearthed core sample that will hopefully reveal clues as to what the void contains. so we have 10 feet of real bedded material. for the most part, it seems relatively natural and normal. except here, right under the bedrock. yeah. potentially is low density material there. and it looks like it might be disturbed. if the plug slipped out of h-8 settled anywhere, it\'s going to be mixed up like this. absolutely. i think we have the potential to have a portion or an aspect of the h-8 plug. yeah. chances are we just may be close to the chopper valve. 	S11E11.4
yeah. chances are we just may be close to the chopper valve. so we\'re close, i guess, is the optimistic take. yeah. h-8 was a very interesting case on it. that\'s a case on where a 12-foot plug just dropped overnight and went somewhere down into a void. so if we can locate where that plug is, it could indicate that we\'re near the chapel vault. possible evidence of the spoils or plug that the team believes may have pushed the chapel vault to a deeper location in the money pit area if they have found the missing plug from h-8 in this mysterious void is it possible that they are close to locating the fabled chapel vault as well? 	S11E11.4
from h-8 in this mysterious void is it possible that they are close to locating the fabled chapel vault as well? we find it just in under the lip of the actual large bedrock overhang. so it\'s possible the depositors were able to work to this point and get in under there. possibly this was an open area. that\'s right. but k-6 183 to 187 looks good. could answer a lot of questions for us. yeah. so we might be close to finding something. we should let rick know. sounds good. so gentlemen, the k-6 hole was meant to find and determine the idea of an anomaly. 	S11E11.4
sounds good. so gentlemen, the k-6 hole was meant to find and determine the idea of an anomaly. alex, terry, and charles meet with rick lagina and other members of the team in the war room to report their potentially important discovery that was made in borehole k-6. what did the hole do? do you think we hit the anomaly? i think it\'s important to show where it is in relation to h-8 can you plot the k-6 can we see it up on the screen? k-6 is right there. i definitely think we hit some loose material and i\'m probably disturbed at about one. 	S11E11.4
k-6 is right there. i definitely think we hit some loose material and i\'m probably disturbed at about one. 83 to 187 and 188. given that low density anomaly seems to jump with the levels at which we lost the plug to the h-8 caisson. i really think that we had a piece of that plug from h-8 and so the void that terry\'s talking about, so i brought up the data from ideon, our borehole k-6 would have gone through here. this is the anomaly they\'re talking about. you\'re not wrong. the h-8 caisson would have gone through and this potentially could be the area where we lost the plug. 	S11E11.4
the h-8 caisson would have gone through and this potentially could be the area where we lost the plug. i think the idea on low-density anomaly is potentially the void that encapsulates the chapel vault. you agree? yeah. exactly. in my mind, that\'s where the treasure of the money pit that was never recovered has been slowly falling deeper and deeper. k-6 drilling has significantly upped the ante, if you will, in terms of the interest in this area. it\'s eminently possible that the chapel vault fell to a greater depth into areas that have been not explored or investigated. so this could lead to possible treasure recovery or something of great importance. 	S11E11.4
so this could lead to possible treasure recovery or something of great importance. well, bottom line is there\'s potential for case on work. everyone should weigh in on. where the drill program goes. agreed. if the question is where do we drill, i\'d want to put one more four hole through that h-8 plug. yeah. i don\'t see how you\'re gonna walk away from it. okay. if the team is able to discover more definitive evidence of man-made workings or valuables in the area around borehole k-6 and h-8 they could, as they have done in the past, install a much larger diameter steel caisson in order to retrieve it. 	S11E11.4
they could, as they have done in the past, install a much larger diameter steel caisson in order to retrieve it. over the next coming days, we\'ll reposition and try to hit the anomaly in the void. that\'d be great. a lot of work to do. let\'s go. that afternoon. lindy, helen, moja. hello. how\'s it going? so, this looks like the dig has expanded yet again since the last time i was here. yes. alex lagina joins helen sheldon and other members of the archaeology team on lot 5 as they continue their investigation of the mysterious stone structure. are you still getting artifacts? 	S11E11.4
are you still getting artifacts? we got a really interesting one. it\'s called a strikalite. it\'s a piece of european flint that they would have used to hit on the metal to make a spark to start a fire. see all those bits that have chipped off it? yeah, right here. this is how you identify it, this kind of worn edge. yeah, there were quite a few worn bits on it. how do you know it\'s european? just by the color. and they used to bring it over to north america as a ballast on ships, and it\'s unusual to find them. 	S11E11.4
and they used to bring it over to north america as a ballast on ships, and it\'s unusual to find them. a piece of flint? a possible european origin? and discovered in the foundation that was buried beneath the circular structure on lot 5? is it possible that it was left here by someone who secretly inhabited this area long ago? if so, might there be more clues in the future that will help the team better understand how it could be related to the oak island mystery? alright, well thank you for the update and then i\'ll stick around and make myself useful. 	S11E11.4
what do you think of these? oh, my heavens. on lot 5, located on the western side of oak island. it\'s copper, i think. yeah, definitely copper, because of the greenness of it all. alex lagina has just made what could be an important discovery in the spoils that have been excavated from the mysterious stone structure. i would say decorative rather than functional just because of the fragility of it. it\'s not the first copper we found on the island like this. peter and david. a few years ago found copper sheeting on the high side of the beach. very cool. 	S11E11.5
peter and david. a few years ago found copper sheeting on the high side of the beach. very cool. two years ago. wow. this is fantastic. while investigating the shoreline of nearby lot 4, old piece of copper and gary drayton, along with brothers peter and david fernetti, found a very similar artifact. an artifact that blacksmithing expert carmen lake believed. might be one of the most significant clues ever found by the team. so, being used like on a box? were there certain boxes that would consistently have that type of sheeting on it? only for valuables. treasure. right. it\'s very old. 	S11E11.5
only for valuables. treasure. right. it\'s very old. when you say very old, how old do you mean? oh, this could go all the way back to 1100s. wow, it\'s pretty old. is it possible? that alex has just found evidence of an ancient container designed to hold something of value in the mysterious foundation on lot 5. if so, what happened to the contents? and could they be buried deeper within this feature or perhaps somewhere deep in the money pit area? i think this is gonna be a good candidate for the lab here. right. we should put it all carefully together so it doesn\'t get. 	S11E11.5
right. we should put it all carefully together so it doesn\'t get. crushed by anything else. okay, i\'ll do that. okay, great. thanks. that afternoon. scoop full of opportunities. oh look at that piece of lumber. yeah, saw that. in the swamp, gary drake, jack begley and billy gerard continue unearthing new potential clues just to the south of the possibly 500 year old stone road or ships wharf. what is it jack? it\'s an old cut piece of wood. there we go. could be a roller, something that was used on top of the stone roadway, and you\'d roll cargo up on it? 	S11E11.5
could be a roller, something that was used on top of the stone roadway, and you\'d roll cargo up on it? sure, and it\'s in the right area right by the road, right? we got wedges, rollers, and the chain hoist to pull, right? yep. could gary and billy be correct that this cut wooden log might have been used along with a large chain that was found one week ago in this area? and which carmen legg believed was designed to lift heavy cargo in order to transport something of great value along the stone road long ago. so we\'ll set it aside and get it tested. 	S11E11.5
so we\'ll set it aside and get it tested. okay, mike. if so, could that suggest the clues that the team has found in the swamp and on lot 5 have revealed more evidence that there could be multiple treasures buried in the money pit area? ooh, i see wood. ooh, look at this. that looks like a bit of decking or a bit of planking. oh, you might be right. it\'s dimensional. yeah, and i\'m saying that it could be a piece of decking or planking, but it could be a bit of railing. i like how you keep thinking ship, because definitely there\'s ship pieces in here. 	S11E11.5
i like how you keep thinking ship, because definitely there\'s ship pieces in here. to me, the most important recover is. we\'ve got out of this dig is the wood, because we can have the wood c-14 you can see it\'s been worked, and i\'m open that when this is tested, we get those same ancient date ranges. that would be fantastic. all right, well, keep an eye out for more wood. i\'ll keep an eye out, mate. and i\'ll go put it up with the other wood we found. thanks, mate. good find, gary. all right, so back to the search. 	S11E11.5
while excavating the earthen barrier between the oak island swamp and the waters of mahone bay, billy gerhardt, jack begley, and gary drayton have just uncovered another compelling find. could that be a piece of the wall that fred nolan found? i think that\'s it. yeah, i mean, if we found the wall in the swamp, that\'d be a major discovery. yeah, rick would be as happy as a pig in the proverbial. yeah. fred nolan\'s wall? after partially draining the swamp in 1969, the late oak island landowner, fred nolan, reportedly discovered evidence of what he believed to be timbered walls or dams buried along both the northern and southern borders of the swamp. 	S11E11.6
of what he believed to be timbered walls or dams buried along both the northern and southern borders of the swamp.  this led fred to theorize that the entire feature had been artificially created centuries ago in order to hide something of great value. that looks like two pieces of wood and they\'ve been cooked to fit like that. there\'s definitely two pieces there. right. is it possible the oak island team has found corroborating evidence that fred\'s theory was true? i think this is the wall. mm-hmm. maybe we can wash it down a little bit. all right. but i think we should call rick to come and see. 	S11E11.6
all right. but i think we should call rick to come and see. yeah, i agree with that, mate. all right. there are so many things connected with oak island that no one has seen for a very long time. fred nolan\'s war is one of them. hey guys. it could be true. i don\'t see a treasure chest. no, but we got news for you. we just wanted to wait for your input before we went any further. that. wow. we were thinking this might be the wall that fred nolan had found. it\'s possible. and those two pieces of wood there looked like it was cooked. 	S11E11.6
it\'s possible. and those two pieces of wood there looked like it was cooked. and the angles looked like they fit together. does it look broken? or, i mean, i got to go over there. between the two, they certainly looked like demerick cut fitted, but there\'s so many fitting together. yeah. hope you don\'t mind having wet feet. it\'s a big piece of wood, just blow it out about that. like you said, cut angle, cut there. yeah. certainly we have the live edge on the backside if we wanted to see 14 it. mm-hmm. it would be interesting to expose the top of that. 	S11E11.6
mm-hmm. it would be interesting to expose the top of that. yeah. certainly looks like it could be pretty important. well, yeah, i would dig that to see if it extends. yeah. but i think we need to understand what this may represent and perhaps its association with that. and that\'s exactly why we stood down. i figured this could be important. yeah. we want to understand this in its totality, right? and the only way to do that is be very specific about how we approach exposing it. it\'s all good news. yeah. i so desperately want this to be the wall that fred had stated was there. 	S11E11.6
it\'s all good news. yeah. i so desperately want this to be the wall that fred had stated was there. so i\'m very hopeful because if you found such a structure in the face of the swamp, i would go on record as saying it had to be closely associated with the original work. there\'s a real story here and we are all endeavoring to come up with an answer and that\'s why we\'re doing the work. okay, well, you know guys, great job. it was a long day in the hot sun. i know, you know, unfortunately every day there\'s an end of the day. 	S11E11.6
how\'s it going alex? good, good to see you again. nice to see you. so what\'s the update, what\'s going on? well, we\'re finally moving ahead now. good. as a new week begins on oak island, brothers rick and marty lagina and their team have good reason to believe that they are on course to finally solve a 229 year old mystery. we\'ve pretty well dealt with all that water situation we\'re dealing with. it\'s all stabilized, the geofoam is in and it went well. yeah, it was amazing. it was amazing. now we\'ve got full control of the water. good. 	S11E12.1
yeah, it was amazing. it was amazing. now we\'ve got full control of the water. good. all right, here we go. let\'s do this. five weeks ago, the oak island team\'s efforts to deepen the early 18th century garden shaft down to a target depth of 95 feet were halted when mysterious voids outside of the structure caused it to flood with salt water. this is where our water starts right here and then it comes in along the side. this made the team wonder if they had encountered one of the legendary flood especially since a seven-foot high tunnel was recently discovered just below the garden shaft, which leads toward the baby blob, an area where water testing has revealed high trace evidence of gold and silver between 80 and 120 feet underground. 	S11E12.1
blob, an area where water testing has revealed high trace evidence of gold and silver between 80 and 120 feet underground. tell us what we\'re gonna do. well, we\'re gonna pump some foam in there and try to get your void filled up. but thankfully, last week, representatives from minova global began applying an industrial compound known as geofoam to fill the voids, stop the flow of water, and to stabilize the shaft. so that duma\'s contracting limited can continue deepening the structure over the course of the next several weeks and finally reach the possible treasure tunnel below. now if we get into this tunnel, and if the tunnel\'s original works... 	S11E12.1
now if we get into this tunnel, and if the tunnel\'s original works... that it probably leads to something good. so we could be close. we\'re going to geofoam everything nice and tight. and then after that, we\'re going to excavate, install a panel, excavate, install a second panel, excavate. so it\'s basically digging again. i see you got the grab on. exactly. we just started digging. so we\'ll be very close to that 89 foot depth. at 89 feet, we\'re getting close to that 95 foot tunnel, but i\'m really excited to get down to depth and see what\'s down there. 	S11E12.1
getting close to that 95 foot tunnel, but i\'m really excited to get down to depth and see what\'s down there. oh, absolutely. for sure. the last two, three days have been, you know, upbeat because the guys were finally moving ahead. we\'re getting away from this water. so yeah. perfect. well thank you roger. sounds good man. i want you to get back to it. absolutely. thanks. talk to you later. later that afternoon. continues their work in the garden shaft, nearly 73 feet to the southwest. hey marty, what\'s going on here? so what we\'re doing here marty, this hole is about 5 feet southwest of h-8 marty lagina joins oak island historian charles barkhouse, geologist terry mathison and surveyor steve guptill. 	S11E12.1
about 5 feet southwest of h-8 marty lagina joins oak island historian charles barkhouse, geologist terry mathison and surveyor steve guptill. as they supervise the drilling of borehole 5.25, 6.25. a borehole that incredibly may be on track to locate a second potential treasure deposit in the money pit area, more than 180 feet underground. the plug that fell out of the hak zone, that could have fallen in this direction. okay. hey mike, what\'s up? i hit the void at 183. alright, so let\'s see what we got. one week ago, while drilling borehole k-6 just 8 feet to the south. 	S11E12.1
alright, so let\'s see what we got. one week ago, while drilling borehole k-6 just 8 feet to the south. the team penetrated a mysterious void at a depth of 183 feet. it is a potentially critical discovery because the void is adjacent to borja h-8 which the oak island team excavated six years ago with a 50 inch diameter caisson that they believed may have come into contact with the fabled chapel vault, which was first reported by frederick blair and his drill operator, william chapel, in 1897. during the team\'s excavation, at a depth of nearly 180 feet, they attempted to penetrate the possible vault and encountered a large void, which caused the spoils, or plumb, inside of the h-8 caisson to fall out, resulting in the believed vault being pushed deeper and somewhere off to the side. 	S11E12.1
of the h-8 caisson to fall out, resulting in the believed vault being pushed deeper and somewhere off to the side. how deep are we? 78 feet? we\'ve got two more cores coming, we\'re going to take a look at those now. the team\'s hope that with this new borehole they can further explore the void they discovered last week and hopefully locate the long-lost chapel vault. there\'s the top of the next run. 80 feet. okay let\'s cover up guys. excuse me, steve-o. sorry, jerry. no problem. okay, there\'s the top. so at some point... so we get some wood here. 	S11E12.1
sorry, jerry. no problem. okay, there\'s the top. so at some point... so we get some wood here. charles, where do you think the wood came from? it possibly could be the chapel shaft. that\'s interesting. it could be skimming along the outside edge. the chapel shaft. in 1931, melbourne chapel, along with his father william and frederick blair constructed a 12 foot by 14 foot shaft down to a depth of 163 feet in order to locate the vault. unfortunately, they were unsuccessful. but if the oak island team is correct that they have found the outer edge of the chapel shaft, could that offer an important clue that they are in the general area where the vault is located? 	S11E12.1
the chapel shaft, could that offer an important clue that they are in the general area where the vault is located? okay. oh! what the hell have you got there? big chunk of steel. oh my, what the heck? it came out of the top of this sample right here. yeah, really? really? couldn\'t this be old time drill pipe? because we know they drilled in these holes and we know they used skinny pipe. no question. i think so, it\'s heavy enough. that could be the drill that found the famous chapel vaults. that could be it, right? they used this skinny little drill. 	S11E12.1
that could be it, right? they used this skinny little drill. back in the 1890\'s they did. if we found something meaningful here, just below the chapel shaft, we could put down another caisson. if we see something worth getting, we will get to it. well done you guys. follow that pipe on down, we\'ll find the chapel vault. all right. go get it. while the operations continue in the money pit area. it\'s time to get to work. along the southern border of the triangle-shaped swamp, metal detection expert gary drayton, jack begley, and billy gerhard continue looking for important clues near a potentially 500-year-old stone road or ship\'s wharf. 	S11E12.1
gary drayton, jack begley, and billy gerhard continue looking for important clues near a potentially 500-year-old stone road or ship\'s wharf. what is the battle plot, mate? are we going deep in here or are you taking this section out? we\'ll try to go along the edge where the... log was... we are ready for some artifacts, mate. okay, me too. in recent weeks, the team has made a number of compelling new discoveries in this area, including new sections of the stone road, an ancient chain and hook that may have been used to lift heavy cargo, and evidence of a wooden wall, which the late fred nolan believed may have been used to artificially create the swamp hundreds of years ago. 	S11E12.1
wooden wall, which the late fred nolan believed may have been used to artificially create the swamp hundreds of years ago. what\'s that? look at that there. it\'s a rock in it. no, it\'s a little piece of wood. yeah. i thought it was a rock when i looked at it. look at the notch in that. yeah. that was pretty deep, billy. yeah, no, well, i mean, you see, we\'re below the bottom of the swamp, right? you know, the bottom of the swamp is up there where the road is, right? yeah. so is this a naturally filled beach, or was it filled by humans? 	S11E12.1
don\'t see a treasure chest. try it, mate. we\'re trying. we have found some strange pieces of wood. let me go grab them. after being alerted to a compelling discovery near the stone road in the southeast corner of the oak island swamp, so this piece came up when we were digging along the muck inside, rick lagina arrives to personally inspect it. yeah, look, that\'s doweled. if you hold it like that. see how that was gone down. if i were to suggest that this is anything like what we found before, i think that it\'s something like the u-shaped structure. 	S11E12.2
were to suggest that this is anything like what we found before, i think that it\'s something like the u-shaped structure. in 2018, rick, marty and the team unearthed a mysterious 65-foot-long wooden construct at smith\'s cove known as the u-shaped structure. you got a roman numeral? yeah, if it is, it\'s a seven, v-one-one. first discovered by dan blankenship in the 1970s and believed to be associated with a flood tunnel that feeds sea water into the money pit area. the u-shaped structure. featured strange roman numerals and hand carved wooden dowels. similar sized dowel like the u-shaped structure they were in at an angle. 	S11E12.2
similar sized dowel like the u-shaped structure they were in at an angle. and thus this part is meant to hold it in place. is it possible that the team has found evidence beneath the stone road in the swamp that suggests it may have been built by the same people who created the u-shaped structure and perhaps the money pit itself? the good thing is if we decide this is an older edge and that\'s where the best c-14 dates are. yeah, but clearly shaped wood that was thrown underneath this stone road. and that\'s why we gotta keep digging. 	S11E12.2
yeah, but clearly shaped wood that was thrown underneath this stone road. and that\'s why we gotta keep digging. yep. yep. let\'s find some more. let\'s find some more. as rick, jack, gary and billy continue searching in the swamp on lot 5, located on the western side of the island. hey, good. how\'s it going out here? good. alex lagina joins jamie cooper, fiona steele, and lindy martin as they carefully investigate a mysterious circular stone structure and a much larger rectangular foundation that was recently unearthed below it. so what\'s new? how\'s it coming? so what we\'re doing now, we\'ve expanded the unit over, we\'re finding artifacts all the way through the film. 	S11E12.2
so what we\'re doing now, we\'ve expanded the unit over, we\'re finding artifacts all the way through the film. okay. one year ago, rick, marty, craig tester, and the team have made a number of discoveries in this feature that suggest it may have been a staging ground for whoever might have buried treasure in the money pit. these finds include a 500-year-old venetian glass bead, a 14th century lead barter token that may be connected to the lead cross unearthed at smith\'s cove in 2017, and several metal tools. that had been scientifically matched to the homestead of sir william phipps, the 17th century english privateer from maine, who some believe buried a vast cache of spanish treasure on oak island back in 1687. 	S11E12.2
century english privateer from maine, who some believe buried a vast cache of spanish treasure on oak island back in 1687. so one of the things that we now realize is that this sort of linear feature that we were looking at isn\'t actually a wall that was there, but we\'re seeing hard rocks that are going past it. okay. so this structure may be... quite a bit bigger than we ever gave it credit for. right, but whatever was happening here, the bigger it gets, the bigger the operation, right? yeah, yeah. the overall size of the dimensions speak to more people being involved than just say a single family. 	S11E12.2
yeah, yeah. the overall size of the dimensions speak to more people being involved than just say a single family. right. so we\'ve got kind of an operation happening here that we know nothing about. yes, exactly. it could be exactly what we\'re looking for. hopefully, yeah, we\'ve got some more work to do. okay, well, i\'ll start sifting. perfect, thank you. i\'ll grab buckets. perfect. while the archeologists carefully remove the soils from the foundation, alex will sift the collected materials for any clues and hopefully valuables. this is kind of something different. oh my goodness. look how flat it is. 	S11E12.2
this is kind of something different. oh my goodness. look how flat it is. yeah. look, you can see almost three rivets on it. yeah. so maybe the top of a trunk. decorative for sure. is that a dalek piece? yeah, just, we find a lot of iron, but we don\'t often find a lot of the flatter pieces and that one looks, you know, kind of decorative. mm-hmm. oh yeah, i see that\'s the rivet right there maybe. yeah. that\'s just something a little bit more decorative. it hints to something else, you know? looks like something you might find on a trunk. 	S11E12.2
it hints to something else, you know? looks like something you might find on a trunk. yeah. if it is off a chest, it would be rugged. it would be a big one. yeah. a decorative iron artifact? potentially from a trunk or chest? if so, what did it contain? and could it be related to the trace evidence of precious metals that have been detected in the money pit area? well, whatever this is, we have the equipment in the lab that we can take a scan of this and basically see through all the crust on it and hopefully get a better idea of what it is. 	S11E12.2
of this and basically see through all the crust on it and hopefully get a better idea of what it is. let\'s bag it up. results of that. that\'s great. as the investigation proceeds on block five. what have you found, ray? i\'ve found some wood chips. rick lagina, along with jack bentley, billy gerhardt, and gary drayton continue making potentially important discoveries in the southern region of the swamp. look at this. here\'s a big timber. there\'s some other bigger pieces of wood over here. it\'s underneath the cobblestone road or this edge. excellent. might be some fasteners in it. 	S11E12.2
it\'s underneath the cobblestone road or this edge. excellent. might be some fasteners in it. correct. yeah. i think it\'s the edge of the road. yeah. i think what we have to do though is push these back and then take this roll of rock out of here to get to the top of that wood. be able to have a good look. stylistically, you make sure some type of construction technique. right. construct there built by humans. if you can definitively say that that construct was a manipulation of the swamp to some agenda, boy that\'d be huge. you know, it makes you think what else might they have hidden in the bog? 	S11E12.2
at the southern border of the oak island swamp, marty lagina and craig tester join rick lagina and other members of the team to inspect the wooden structure that was just unearthed beneath the stone road. that\'s the edge. really? you believe it ended right there? yeah. there was two logs underneath the edge of the rope, but it looked really like they were fitted together, like you took one log and, you know. like if you were building a cabin, like that kind of thing. there was brush just like under the construct itself and smaller logs so it\'s going to underpin the road. 	S11E12.3
there was brush just like under the construct itself and smaller logs so it\'s going to underpin the road. and that has stopped abruptly. really? yeah, yeah. swamp muck mixed with bigger logs on the bottom that were running perpendicular to the road. but it was also well enough into the structure of the stones that you can say it was put down during the construction of the road. yeah, i got it, yeah. okay. there\'s big timbers underneath the stone road, which just underscores that that was a massive undertaking. somebody put that road in for a specific reason, and i think they wanted it to not be found after they were done. 	S11E12.3
that road in for a specific reason, and i think they wanted it to not be found after they were done. it could be leading us back to where the treasure is. and then just before we got to the end of the road here, i mean, we have pulled up some really, really nice artifacts, old-looking chains. some really interesting chains. i haven\'t seen this chain, i heard about this chain. very unusual. this looks old. two weeks ago, while excavating the southern edge of the potentially 500-year-old stone road, the oak island team uncovered a large hand-wrought chain and hook, which blacksmithing expert carmen lay dated to the 16th century. 	S11E12.3
the oak island team uncovered a large hand-wrought chain and hook, which blacksmithing expert carmen lay dated to the 16th century. is it possible that this artifact was once used in the swamp area to offload cargo from a ship onto oak island? the chain was a three point hitch. and forged by the look of it. might have even been a four point hitch. to me, you could stay there on a nice stable surface, hook a box or something very heavy three point hitch. and unload out here. because if you\'re pulling with a three point hitch, you can pull it across this heavy ground and then get it to the bog and pull it right up that road. 	S11E12.3
can pull it across this heavy ground and then get it to the bog and pull it right up that road. if you\'re trying to fit the chain to the road. to me that\'s an explanation. it really is. i think it\'s an important discovery. we have clearly defined the extent of the construct of the road and where it transitions to the beach. does it align with the idea that a larger ship offshore, a tender comes, brings the material to a crafted slipway or a wharf or dock? sure, it fits perfectly. great. very interesting all the stuff you have. 	S11E12.3
sure, it fits perfectly. great. very interesting all the stuff you have. hopefully they can tell part of the story. hopefully it ties together to give us a date and hopefully we find something even better yet. yeah. what\'s next here? what are you gonna do next? we\'re only beginning to get to that point. oh you\'re gonna keep digging underneath where billy is? yeah. okay well the best dig is yet to come. yeah. let\'s get it done. yep thank you for the update. pretty cool. as the dig for clues continues in the that\'s 118. 118. thank you, colton. 	S11E12.3
pretty cool. as the dig for clues continues in the that\'s 118. 118. thank you, colton. and while the core drilling operation in borehole 9.25, 6.25 proceeds in the money pit area. hey, how\'s she going? carmen. welcome to the new and improved lab. all right, yeah, let\'s do it. alex lagina, charles barkhouse, and argumentallurgist emma culligan meet with blacksmithing expert carmen leigh in the newly constructed oak island laboratory. so we have finds that were made on lot 5 for you today. oh, ok. they are eager to hear carmen\'s assessment of the copper and iron artifacts that were recently discovered within the large foundation beneath the circular stone structure. 	S11E12.3
carmen\'s assessment of the copper and iron artifacts that were recently discovered within the large foundation beneath the circular stone structure. i think we should start with this copper. i actually pulled this out of the sifting box. i\'d love to know what your opinion is. ok. i see that the other pieces are very thin. except for this one here seems to be a little thicker. yeah. that is bigger, it looks like it. it is, yeah. and it\'s rounded. i also tapered as well. it does look like a bit of a pattern on the end there. it has to be something decorative. 	S11E12.3
i\'m wondering if that could be a jewelry thing? like a small jewelry chest or something? yeah, it is very possible. in the oak island laboratory, blacksmithing expert carmen lake has just confirmed that a number of copper pieces found one week ago on lot 5 may have been used to decorate a small chest designed for carrying valuables. what about these iron pieces? i don\'t know, have a look. it\'s all very thin, like off of a strap. so it\'s not for a barrel or a small round container. there\'s a strap to secure a box. a heavily banded and heavily fortified box. 	S11E12.4
there\'s a strap to secure a box. a heavily banded and heavily fortified box. what would be the purpose of that? cash box, maybe? play box, yeah. that would be very interesting. i have to get a ct scan on that one. very good. earlier this morning. emma analyzed the iron artifact using two scanning devices. the first, known as the skyscan 1273 ct scanner, emits non-destructive x-ray radiation that penetrates corrosion on artifacts, producing high definition, three dimensional images of them. the second, known as an x-ray fluorescent spectrometer or xrf device. can identify the type of metal an artifact is composed of. 	S11E12.4
can identify the type of metal an artifact is composed of. so does it look like there\'s two pieces joined? it does. there\'s two materials. so i did do an xr point scan on that material as well. and it was lead. oh. yeah. oh, okay. and then the rest of the body is iron. my puzzling thing is why is the lead in the iron as well? it is a... common thing to find within old english iron, is that some lead content, which fits 1600s, early 1700s. the dating on the artifact could fit really well with the theory surrounding sir william phipps, who was a privateer, and we have a theorist who has placed phipps in this region, potentially with a ship full of illicit silver, in need of a place to hide it. 	S11E12.4
placed phipps in this region, potentially with a ship full of illicit silver, in need of a place to hide it. we know that phipps found silver on the concepcion, according to the theory. of 32nd degree freemason scott clark. in the fall of 1687, the english privateer, sir william phipps, conspired with a high-ranking freemason from nova scotia named andrew belcher to bury spanish treasure they had salvaged from the shipwreck known as the concepcion on oak island. it\'s intriguing, especially given that the feature on lot 5 appears to have been covered over. yeah. is it possible that the team has found more evidence in the feature on lot 5, proving that this theory could be true? 	S11E12.4
possible that the team has found more evidence in the feature on lot 5, proving that this theory could be true? we could be looking at a small but strongly constructive box. which means it could have been part of any treasure that was here. that\'s right. thank you, carmen. very good. see you later. as the team concludes their meeting with blacksmithing expert carmen lay, and while the investigation in the triangle-shaped swamp continues. all right, let\'s see what we get up here. mike\'s gonna give us some material right now. other members of the team anxiously supervise the core drilling operation in borehole 9.25, 6.25. 	S11E12.4
other members of the team anxiously supervise the core drilling operation in borehole 9.25, 6.25. here comes the anaconda. as they have now reached the target depth of some 180 feet, where they hope to encounter a void and evidence of the fabled chapel vault. what\'s the bottom? the bottom\'s 190. 190, ok. that\'s about right. we\'ve got slush and loose material. that\'d be representative of the void. almost no recovery here. yep. this is the biggest stretch where we have nothing other than slush. there\'s our void. okay. look at this. there\'s some wood fibers. fragments of wood found in the void more than 180 feet underground in the money pit area? 	S11E12.4
fragments of wood found in the void more than 180 feet underground in the money pit area? is it possible? that they could be related to the large object that was pushed aside by the nearby a.j. kason six years ago. and we might see the plug, the h-8 plug. we may hit a chunk of the plug. and the boys will push on. if the team has found the missing plug from h-8 and potentially the vault in this borehole, then the next core will hopefully reveal the proof. hey guys. charles, welcome back. yeah, well, where are we and what did you find? 	S11E12.4
hey guys. charles, welcome back. yeah, well, where are we and what did you find? an apparent void. oh, really? i mean, it\'s really quite exciting. here it comes. class cord. you finished up where, mike? two-ten. very good. this is one of the most important targets in the money pit. because if we can find the lost plug from h-8 it might help us find the treasure. so we\'re really excited about this. what you got, terry? unfortunately, it\'s not void. we\'re well into bedrock. that\'s it. well, we don\'t like to see that, but there it is. after several moments of great anticipation. 	S11E12.4
that\'s it. well, we don\'t like to see that, but there it is. after several moments of great anticipation. it appears that the legendary chapel vault remains elusive. however, is it possible that it still lies within this void, perhaps within just feet of the team\'s current position? oak island never ceases to surprise us. i think we should call it a day, charles. we\'re gonna go through the buckets today. yeah, we are. meanwhile, nearly half a mile to the west on lot 5, alex lagina. assists the archaeology team as they search for valuable clues inside the stone structure. 	S11E12.4
assists the archaeology team as they search for valuable clues inside the stone structure. oh my god! i think it\'s a bead. it looks similar to the one we had last time i believe. really? oh, that\'s gorgeous. right? oh, wow, yeah, look at that. that is exactly the same pattern from the original bead that we found. that\'s probably venetian. that\'s just incredible to find two beads from the same piece of jewelry. yeah. amazing. another possible venetian glass bead found in the buried stone structure? given that this type of italian jewelry, which could date to as early as the 15th century, was used not only for fine adornments, but also as a form of currency, is it possible that they may be related to the fragments of the decorative container that was also recently discovered in this feature? 	S11E12.4
possible that they may be related to the fragments of the decorative container that was also recently discovered in this feature? so we\'ve got two of these now. yeah. if so, what else might the team find as they continue to dig? okay. i will go find you some more. perfect, thank you. nice job, boy. yes. the bead in combination with the decorative iron piece that we thought might have gone on a chest, that is starting to say maybe somebody left a chest of valuables here. to me, that\'s exciting. what do you got? what did you find? catching on swimming. 	S11E12.4
oh, look at that. what do you got? a coin maybe? what? a coin? it\'s got a coin? yeah. what? cool. hahaha. while sifting through spoils from the mysterious stone structure on lot 5 of oak island. yeah, i think that is a coin. really? yep. oh wow. hahaha. archaeologist lindy martin has just made a potentially... valuable discovery. that\'s copper for sure. it like almost tapers on the edges instead of being flat like modern coins. yeah i don\'t see a milled edge. it\'s rounded. rounded exactly. it\'s not perfectly regular which would say older i think. it could be very old. 	S11E12.5
it\'s rounded. rounded exactly. it\'s not perfectly regular which would say older i think. it could be very old. a copper coin and without a milled or ridged edge? during the late 17th century in england, the famed scholar, sir isaac newton, who was also the master of the royal mint, implemented coin designs with milled edges in order to combat the counterfeiting of currency. you know, that really attests to the importance of screening too, you know. that\'s an amazing find, that\'s really cool. is it possible that this coin, bearing no milled edges, could date back prior to the 17th century, or perhaps? 	S11E12.5
is it possible that this coin, bearing no milled edges, could date back prior to the 17th century, or perhaps? even earlier, if so, could it help the team identify who originally created this mysterious stone structure? can you see anything on it? well, there is something down here at the bottom. and i think the ct scan will show at least some details on the front of him. but i think there\'s going to be a little bit of a pattern that maybe we can identify. good find, lindy. thanks. nice job. thank you. well done. both of the shifters today so far are doing our best. 	S11E12.5
thanks. nice job. thank you. well done. both of the shifters today so far are doing our best. absolutely. yeah, you guys are doing great. the lucky shifters, i guess. nice job, everybody. all right. let\'s find some more. as operations continue in the garden shaft, as well as on lot 5, back in the southeastern region of the swamp, marty lagina, metal detection expert gary drayton and billy gerhardt continue searching for another breakthrough discovery near the potentially 500-year-old. stone road. no metal it\'s... oh, i don\'t think there\'s any metals. all right, let\'s get ready for the next load. 	S11E12.5
no metal it\'s... oh, i don\'t think there\'s any metals. all right, let\'s get ready for the next load. thanks for this one mate. very very good. come on. let\'s go find some treasure. there\'s nothing in here, this is quiet. what we got here? it looks like a bit of the barrel stave. maybe. similar to those barrel staves we found digging in the swamp there. yeah. it looks like a barrel stave, gary, because it\'s wider here than it is there. yeah. i don\'t know what\'s going on here. probably where it ripped out, but yeah. i\'d say that\'s a bit of a barrel. 	S11E12.5
probably where it ripped out, but yeah. i\'d say that\'s a bit of a barrel. yeah. well, one thing for sure, we\'ve got enough of those barrel staves that were recovered not too far away. we can compare it. that\'s right. well... we\'re trying to see whether the idea that this is an offloading area is correct or not. a barrel certainly would fit with that. yeah. that\'s how they transported stuff. a barrel stave? found near the stone road or ships wharf? could gary be correct? that it might be related to the pieces of wooden cargo barrels that were unearthed in this area three years ago, at which carmen lake believed could be as much as 600 years old. 	S11E12.5
were unearthed in this area three years ago, at which carmen lake believed could be as much as 600 years old. every time we dig in and around the swamp, we find something. the stone road, the paved area, the ramp, lots of artifacts. so we\'re going to continue digging. we\'ll do a little analysis on that, but i\'m wanting to find more stuff. oh, yeah, some coins. put it right over there. thank you. sure. what the hell\'s going on? is catching on something. i wonder if it\'s wood or rocks. there\'s a boulder. i don\'t know if that means that\'s the end of the road. 	S11E12.5
there\'s a boulder. i don\'t know if that means that\'s the end of the road. i don\'t know, we want to do a little shovel work to check that. that\'s up to you. gary, i\'ll go have a look. yeah. go have a look, gary. let\'s go have a look. check it out. where\'s the boulder? to your left. oh, right here. yeah. and that\'s the first one. so what you\'re suggesting is there could be a row here? well, if just from my angle, it could be in alignment with the stone road. yeah. what do you think in here? 	S11E12.5
it looks similar to the rocks on the stone roadway. yeah, that easily could be the road extension. it is a moment of great excitement for marty lagina, gary drayton and billy gerhardt. that\'s another big rock next to it. yeah. as they may have just discovered another section of the potentially 500-year-old stone road, or shipswarm, in the southeast corner of the oak island swamp. another big rock next to that big rock. what do you think? those are the first two big rocks we\'ll have to dig a little further. so you\'re thinking these are like retaining rocks? yeah, it would only be the retaining edge i would say for sure. 	S11E12.6
yeah, it would only be the retaining edge i would say for sure. i don\'t think it\'s possible to stand and look at that stone road and not think that this had to have a special purpose. it\'s a rather massive construction and it had to be done for a reason. what was it for? i\'m prepared to just see what the data suggests as we dig more. that could lead us directly to what we\'ve been seeking for years. well, what i would say, billy, is just as you\'re going this way, look for others. hm. kind of scrape along. 	S11E12.6
hm. kind of scrape along. all right. i\'m gonna go start that pump, gary. yep. i\'m sorry. one thing that\'s really exciting about being in the swamp is that possibility that billy sticks that bucket in. and next thing you know, you come up with some really great old artifacts. three interesting pieces of wood. barrel staves. got two strips. and then this looks like a handle. yeah. rounded edges. it\'s a peculiar piece of wood. yeah. i wonder if it\'s like an old pickaxe handle. could be. or an axe. it almost looks hand-shaped. a hand-shaped tool? could it have been used in the original construction of the stone road? 	S11E12.6
it almost looks hand-shaped. a hand-shaped tool? could it have been used in the original construction of the stone road? if so, is it possible that scientific analysis might help identify not only its age, but also who brought it to oak island? okay, let\'s get back to work. yep. there\'s another rock there. there\'s more bigger rocks coming this way. in the line? yeah. okay, bailey, we\'ll go have a look. this was the original rock, yeah? there, yeah. then there was buried, then there\'s another one there. there\'s a pretty steady row right to, and then there\'s a flat one lower behind you, gary. 	S11E12.6
there\'s a pretty steady row right to, and then there\'s a flat one lower behind you, gary. see the- there\'s one here, one there, one there. yeah, but what\'s that mean? maybe some buried in between. i think there are clues in the swamp. clearly there are. i have been absolutely wrong about the extent of- the workings in the swamp. i thought there was nothing there. there\'s a lot there. some good stuff in there, i\'m sure. now, marty was never a big fan of the swamp, but the more discoveries we have found in the swamp over the years, the more i see the twinkle in marty\'s eye. 	S11E12.6
the more discoveries we have found in the swamp over the years, the more i see the twinkle in marty\'s eye. i think he\'s beginning to like the swamp. you know, we may want to take that over a little bit. i don\'t know if that means that\'s the end of the road. you know, we thought it might\'ve been the log, but the log was an edge. well, let\'s see, you know rick\'s coming a little bit, let\'s see what he wants to do. i think we should have the rest of the guys look at it. this could be very important. 	S11E12.6
i think we should have the rest of the guys look at it. this could be very important. yeah. then i\'ll kick it around with rick and craig and we\'ll decide what to do. i\'m telling you, mate, we are on to something here. for rick, marty, craig and the team, the 229-year-old oak island mystery becomes more complex by the day. but as they keep digging... thrilling and applying disciplined science to the discoveries being made all across these 140 acres. one thing appears to be certain. oak island has kept an incredible secret for hundreds of years. at now, it is perhaps just a matter of time until the laginas and their team unearth the truth behind it. 	S11E12.6
s11e13.1 hey, gentlemen. money and time are getting more precious. absolutely. time especially. as a new day begins on oak island for brothers rick and marty lagina and members of their team. mother nature and some other things got us in the garden shaft. they have gathered in the war room to discuss the most ambitious and challenging operations that they are conducting in the hopes of solving a 229-year-old mystery. the excavation and drilling programs in the fabled money pit area. after much deliberation, rick and i, craig, with input from a lot of you actually, we have decided that we don\'t feel we have the requisite targets for canisters at this time, for case ones. 	S11E13.1
actually, we have decided that we don\'t feel we have the requisite targets for canisters at this time, for case ones. so we\'re going to just put it off till next year as far as the canisters go. we thought there would be targets out there that we could say, ok, we need a can here, we need a can here, we need a can here. and unfortunately, we don\'t have that at this point. it\'s a timing issue. we can\'t get the garden shop done in the time it would take for a case on work on additional targets. so we\'re not going to put cans down. 	S11E13.1
so we\'re not going to put cans down. are they pumping right now? they\'re pumping it out at the same time? yeah, that\'s what they\'re doing right now. they\'re lowering the pump, and we\'re going to see where the sediment\'s at. it was rick, marty, and craig\'s hope that by now representatives from dumas contracting limited would have been able to complete the reconstruction and extension of the mid-18th century garden shed down to a target depth of 95 feet. where it is expected to breach a 7-foot-high tunnel. a tunnel that leads directly west into the so-called baby blob, where water testing in previously drilled boreholes has identified a massive source of gold, silver, and other metals between 80 and 120 feet underground. 	S11E13.1
in previously drilled boreholes has identified a massive source of gold, silver, and other metals between 80 and 120 feet underground. this is where our water starts, right here, and then it comes in along the side. however, several weeks ago, after saltwater began flowing into the garden shaft at a depth of nearly 67 feet, dumas has been working tirelessly to seal any leaks and stabilize the structure. and now, even though they are finally able to continue the efforts to reach the potential treasure tunnel below the shaft, the workspace that dumas requires to safely operate in the money pit area will prevent rick, marty, craig, and the team from conducting what they hoped would be a second major operation this year. 	S11E13.1
will prevent rick, marty, craig, and the team from conducting what they hoped would be a second major operation this year. the installation of several 10-foot diameter steel caissons at other locations in the money pit area where evidence of not only man-made workings but also precious metals have been recovered between depths of 150 and 180 feet underground. so then what are we going to do in the money pit instead? well, to address everyone\'s concerns, what are we going to do? currently, the sonic rig is still there. there\'s a lot of unique opportunities left to come up with high-value targets. 	S11E13.1
currently, the sonic rig is still there. there\'s a lot of unique opportunities left to come up with high-value targets. yeah. so, we\'re going to get more data. we will continue with the vertical drilling with a sonic rig, which will allow us to be most efficient when we finally do mobilize the oscillator next year. yep. and don\'t forget guys, the garden shaft isn\'t finished. there\'s still a lot of work to do there yet. they\'re going to come down on this tunnel. when they get close, we\'re going to start drilling. and then as they come down through that, we\'re going to see how this tunnel lies. 	S11E13.1
and then as they come down through that, we\'re going to see how this tunnel lies. we\'re going to see how it was built. we\'re going to see where it goes. that tunnel is going in the direction of where precious metals are coming from, which is very exciting to me. dumas suggested it could get 40 feet out. well, you\'re talking 80 foot diameter. from an informational perspective, it is literally a big dig. yeah. as dumas continues extending the garden shaft to a total depth of 95 feet, where they hope to breach a mysterious tunnel. in the coming days, once they have reached a depth of 90 feet, they will use a lateral probe drilling device capable of reaching up to 40 feet outside of the garden shaft. 	S11E13.1
feet, they will use a lateral probe drilling device capable of reaching up to 40 feet outside of the garden shaft. this will allow the team to not only collect samples of the tunnel in order to determine just who may have built it, but also, hopefully, pinpoint the source of all the precious metals that have been detected in the area. i know that there\'s been some setbacks, but when i look around the war room table and i look in the eyes of the guys, i don\'t see any sense of being done. i see enthusiasm. i see some really smart people all focused on a singular agenda, trying to solve the mystery. 	S11E13.1
i see enthusiasm. i see some really smart people all focused on a singular agenda, trying to solve the mystery. so i know we\'re making progress. you know, there\'s every reason to believe that as we move out in the year, that we are really going to use this opportunity and turn it into a positive. yeah. okay, let\'s get back to the things we can do. yep, agreed. later that afternoon, as the team from dumas contracting limited continues the extension of the garden shaft in the money pit area. all right, in fact, time. oops-a. god, i love this place. 	S11E13.1
all right, in fact, time. oops-a. god, i love this place. rick lagina and craig tester join metal detection expert gary drayton and billy gerhardt near the southern edge of the triangle-shaped swamp. got that stone roadway. we\'re close to shore. imagine how many people landed on this beach back in the day, came ashore. oh, look at that. kind of looks similar to the rocks on the stone roadway. yeah. one week ago, while excavating near the massive cobblestone road in the southeast corner of the swamp, marty lagina, billy and gary uncovered yet another possible section of the mysterious construct. 	S11E13.1
in the southeast corner of the swamp, marty lagina, billy and gary uncovered yet another possible section of the mysterious construct. this is a type of road that was built in europe in the 1500s. since the team\'s discovery of the stone road in 2020, experts such as historian terry devone have speculated that it could be as much as 500 years old. the stone road looks exactly like this. and incredibly, in 2021, while visiting alcadão de serra, portugal, a location that served as a stronghold for the portuguese sect of the knights templar from the 12th to the 16th centuries, rick and members of the team were shown a nearly identical feature. 	S11E13.1
knights templar from the 12th to the 16th centuries, rick and members of the team were shown a nearly identical feature. the bottom there is different, way more rockier and bigger rocks. guess we gotta dig, right? yeah, gotta dig. yep. craig, there\'s a rock here. and there\'s one in the ground here. and there\'s one here. and there\'s one here. four in a row? four or five there at least, yeah. and it\'s all very uniform. rocks don\'t end up in a straight line like that normally. yeah. hey, rick. anything to see? we got down deeper here we started hitting rocks everywhere so to me it almost looks like it\'s an extension part of the stone road or work material but it\'s definitely way, way more rocks than there should naturally be here. 	S11E13.1
s11e13.2 like a ramp and elevation wise it just seems to be a continual slope coming on down with this this would be definitely the lowest part it\'s probably went right onto the beach well definitely different it\'s a tough one could be an extension could be in the southeast corner of the oak island swamp, rick lagina and members of the team have just discovered a possible ramp feature connected to the stone road. we\'re not going to pull this out right now. i think we want to continue looking that way, because he hasn\'t gone deeper there. that\'s basically it. 	S11E13.2
i think we want to continue looking that way, because he hasn\'t gone deeper there. that\'s basically it. and if it\'s continually going lower, then it could be right there. if the team has actually found a ramp connecting the stone road to the shoreline, could it represent more evidence that the road, or ship\'s wharf, was constructed in order to move heavy cargo from a large ship  onto oak island? craig felt there were some rocks that one could suggest that there were a little mini wharf. why don\'t you go ahead and metal detect this? and it certainly does look like that. 	S11E13.2
why don\'t you go ahead and metal detect this? and it certainly does look like that. could a small boat pull up to it? sure. and my hope is that as we excavate, we\'ll come to a greater understanding of what the stone represents. no, no metals in there. why is it there? why was it built? who built it? we have that construct, but we have no explanation for it. well, you should dig over here and then we can clean this area up and then have a go at looking at this area in its entirety? yeah, i like that idea. 	S11E13.2
yeah, i like that idea. okay. let\'s get after it. as the investigation in the swamp continues. h.i. 6175. here we go. this is a little bit to the north and west of the actual h.a. caisson. yeah. in the money pit area, geologist terry matheson and oak island historian paul trautman are overseeing the drilling of a new borehole known as hi 6.75. a borehole nearly two feet from h-8 one of the team\'s additional targets of interest located more than 50 feet southwest of the garden shaft. thank you. the h-8 case arm intersected possibly in the chapel vault. 	S11E13.2
thank you. the h-8 case arm intersected possibly in the chapel vault. this hole will hopefully cover that ground. we could recover that. there\'d be a lot of artifacts. this could be the original location. in 2017, after recovering pieces of parchment and leather bookbinding in a six-inch borehole known as h-8 the oak island team excavated a five-foot diameter steel caisson in the hopes of encountering the legendary chapel vault, a large wooden chest that was reportedly drilled into by frederick player and william chapel in 1897, and which was believed to contain both gold and parchment documents. we have a 14-foot plug right now, but we\'re stuck. 	S11E13.2
we have a 14-foot plug right now, but we\'re stuck. incredibly, the oak island team\'s caisson struck a large object at a depth of 170 feet. something was in front of the can and we were pushing it for a while until it hit something hard. but unfortunately, as they extended the caisson deeper in the hopes of breaching the potential vault, it was pushed deeper and into a void somewhere off to the side. i\'m glad that we\'re getting it done. we\'re going to 171. yeah, that\'s right. if the team is able to not only penetrate the mysterious void, but also locate the fabled chapel vault, once the garden shaft project is complete, they will be able to excavate a 10-foot diameter caisson and hopefully retrieve it. 	S11E13.2
once the garden shaft project is complete, they will be able to excavate a 10-foot diameter caisson and hopefully retrieve it. hopefully, we can get a few more answers with this borehole, but right now, we\'re well above target horizon. we\'re on 28 feet below grade. hi 6.75 is going to build up a lot of secrets. yes. as the core drilling operation continues in the money pit area. hey. hey, how\'s it going? at the oak island interpretive center. rick lagina and his nephew alex are meeting with gary drayton, archaeologist laird niven, and archaeometallurgist emma culligan. all of this is coming from inside that circular depression. 	S11E13.2
all of this is coming from inside that circular depression. they are eager to receive gary, laird, and emma\'s analysis of a coin as well as a potentially 500-year-old phoenician bead that were both found one week ago in a large stone structure located near the shoreline on lot 5. let\'s have a look, mate. it\'s the right size for a penny or a half penny. oh yeah, no mistaking that. king george? well, let\'s take a look, emma. earlier today, emma scanned the coin with the skyscan 1273 ct scanner, which emits non-destructive x-ray radiation to penetrate corrosion and reveal the object\'s finer details. 	S11E13.2
coin with the skyscan 1273 ct scanner, which emits non-destructive x-ray radiation to penetrate corrosion and reveal the object\'s finer details. oh, there you go. okay. right there, i see on the right-hand side. oh, yeah. it should say george\'s three wrecks. wrecks, okay. yeah, it\'s latin children. yeah, that\'s definitely. so 1760 to 1820. yeah. i think it\'s the first edition head. yeah, an early head. yeah. so that takes us into 1770s. an english penny or half penny that could date back nearly three decades prior to the discovery of the money pit in 1795? if so, who left it in the foundation on lot 5? 	S11E13.2
if so, who left it in the foundation on lot 5? someone who may have left something of value behind? or was it someone looking for the fabled treasure? we think we\'re still in the foundation, and this just came from the fill that\'s actually really close to the top of it. yeah. it\'s also in the stuff that was thrown onto this feature. it means whatever\'s underneath it is older. older, yeah. the money pit was supposed to have been discovered in 1795, and that\'s why these 1760s dates that we\'re getting off the coin and the other artifacts make lot 5 so fascinating. 	S11E13.2
and that\'s why these 1760s dates that we\'re getting off the coin and the other artifacts make lot 5 so fascinating. if this feature was covered over, it may have been associated with whatever did happen in the money pit prior to its discovery. so in our world, that means maybe this lot 5 feature is associated with early depositor activity. you were here for this as well. yeah. this was exciting too. it\'s a blast bead. oh, wow. yeah. it is colored. this is a stretched bead. you know they have... different colors of enamel laid in and then they\'d stretch it for like 150 feet and then just cut off the beads. 	S11E13.2
colors of enamel laid in and then they\'d stretch it for like 150 feet and then just cut off the beads. so it\'s probably off a bracelet or a necklace? yeah, most likely from venice. wow. in 1470 ad, a specialized method for the production of fine glass bead jewelry was developed in venice, italy. as demand quickly grew, venetian glass beads also became a highly valued type of barter currency along trade routes in europe, india, africa, and the new world. interestingly, we did find another one earlier on. this one\'s even smaller. is it possible that if the team has actually found two venetian glass beads in the mysterious foundation on lot 5, could there be even more valuable artifacts waiting to be recovered deeper below? 	S11E13.2
beads in the mysterious foundation on lot 5, could there be even more valuable artifacts waiting to be recovered deeper below? yeah, so very, very similar, which means there\'s probably a lot of them out there. yeah. yeah. if this was truly valuable, maybe this and the other things we\'re finding could be a trade item, could be just in a chest of valuables that was taken from somebody. we need to find an expert because feeds are an extremely complex subject. and that\'s why we need someone who\'s been doing it for years and years and years. that little item there might be highly significant. 	S11E13.2
coming down. copy that. and while operations to deepen the garden ship continue in the money pit area. in treasure. okay, here we go. all it takes is one good find. that\'s right. rick lagina, gary dre and billy gerhardt continue searching for valuable clues near the potentially 500 year old stone road in the southeast corner of the swamp. alright. i saw that. look. oh, i see it, mate. that\'s nice. oh, i see the place you call it. that\'s gorgeous, mate. oh, look at that. and there\'s another piece here as well. where? there. you see the rim? yep, yep. 	S11E13.3
oh, look at that. and there\'s another piece here as well. where? there. you see the rim? yep, yep. all right, let\'s see if this is a match. oh, that is absolutely stunning. that\'s beautiful, mate. what is that? that\'s old. that is some fine china by the look of it. i mean, this is iron stuff. i know that this chinese porcelain was really, really popular. that\'s what the portuguese fleets used to bring up through these trade routes. really, really nice. potentially ancient chinese pottery? if so, could gary drayton be correct that it may offer another portuguese connection? 	S11E13.3
potentially ancient chinese pottery? if so, could gary drayton be correct that it may offer another portuguese connection? to the stone road in the oak island swamp. according to documented history, beginning in the early 16th century, portuguese explorers, including vasco da gama, who is also a member of the portuguese sect of the knights templar, made extensive trading expeditions to china, bringing back, among other goods, fine chinese porcelain, which then became highly traded throughout the region and the americas. well, you look, you see the age on the back. you see that crackling on the back? mm-hmm. it\'s been in there a while. 	S11E13.3
you see that crackling on the back? mm-hmm. it\'s been in there a while. what we\'re looking for is to try to establish a connection between these artifacts and the actual physical constructs. stone road, stone road. it\'s possible this pottery will give us great insight into what this feature represents, because that stone road, to me, is still inexplicable. there\'s something right there. something? you seen it? yep. ooh, big chunk. that\'s a big chunk too. yeah, that\'s a big chunk. okay, mate, got it in me hand, mate. i\'ll wait till we get out. here\'s another one, gary. here\'s another one. 	S11E13.3
i\'ll wait till we get out. here\'s another one, gary. here\'s another one. here\'s another one? yep. that is so fantastic. i think this may be something different. is it? yeah, i think this is teacup. don\'t get any better than that, mate. what a perfect start to the morning. let\'s see, look at that. it\'s not a teacup or a bowl. oh yeah, actually, it\'s two different vessels. where\'s the silver spoon? so with it, right? that would be nice. i bet there\'s more in here. yep. oh, here we go, here we go. oh, look at that, billy. yeah. 	S11E13.3
i bet there\'s more in here. yep. oh, here we go, here we go. oh, look at that, billy. yeah. i love this blue glaze. oh, yeah, that\'s a chinese design on it as well. turned into the swamp tea party, isn\'t it? if you found all that pottery, it should be a pretty good chance to find them something else there, too, right? yeah. with that amount of finds, i think we have to go through it by hand. agreed, mate, and i\'ll put these to one side because i\'m turning into gary potter. wow, rick. and billy continue searching for clues in the swamp. 	S11E13.3
wow, rick. and billy continue searching for clues in the swamp. back in the money pit area. let\'s get ready for another core, here it comes. one eighteen. thank you, colton. other members of the team continue monitoring the core drilling operation in borehole hi 6.75. a borehole where they hope to recover evidence of the fabled chapel vault. nearly 180 feet below ground. wow, that doesn\'t look good. little bit of pvc. yeah. you know what that means, my friend. it means we\'re drifting. yeah, that means we\'re not going straight down. yeah, unfortunately, the drill drifts off. it looks like we tagged into either h7 or maybe h6.5 that\'s in this area. 	S11E13.3
it looks like we tagged into either h7 or maybe h6.5 that\'s in this area. and so we\'re going down and getting that pvc. unfortunately, the drill pipe has veered off course and apparently encountered another nearby borehole that was previously drilled by the team. very difficult to drill a straight hole. sometimes these holes wander an average five or six feet. and if the borehole walks a little bit and gets into one of those other ones, it\'s almost impossible to get it out. so we\'re going to move the rig. if we\'re still in the right area or heading for the right area, then we can keep going. 	S11E13.3
if we\'re still in the right area or heading for the right area, then we can keep going. it\'s discouraging the idea that we\'re passing through an old borehole. yes. that\'s not good. we don\'t want to keep chewing on this all the way down. that\'s right. yeah. we got to get them a new spot. i agree. while terry and paul re-grew in the money pit area. i\'m really excited to see what this guy has to say. yeah, i think this is the place, jack. jack begley and oak island historian, charles barkhouse, have traveled some 50 miles northeast to halifax, nova scotia. 	S11E13.3
jack begley and oak island historian, charles barkhouse, have traveled some 50 miles northeast to halifax, nova scotia. i think it\'s back here, jack. hey, how you doing? good, how are you? not too bad. here, they are meeting with philip doucet, a specialist in glass bead design at his studio in order to have him examine the believed venetian beads that were recently found on lot 5. so we were working on oak island and we\'ve uncovered this buried feature and while digging amongst the boulders, our archeologists found these beads. they believe that they could be venetian beads. very nice. 	S11E13.3
they believe that they could be venetian beads. very nice. and they\'ve come out of the grounds, and they were there for a while. the signs of the pitting that you can see on the ends. well, i know exactly what these appear to be. these are drawn glass beads. and what really identifies these as drawn is that the stripes are incredibly straight. and that comes from pulling. against the glass. it pulls them out straight. oh, yeah. these beads, i\'m very confident were made in venice. this color, the red and the blue and the white are very early formulations of glass in that color. 	S11E13.3
were made between 1500 and 1650. really? in halifax, nova scotia, these are very old. glass bead expert philip doucet has just confirmed that the two beads that were recently unearthed in the stone structure on lot 5 are phoenician trade beads and date as far back as the early 16th century. the date range for these beads, you\'re extremely confident that it falls into that timeframe. that\'s correct. drawn glass, white, striped. they were a precious commodity. wow. if there was a really brisk trade going on, five or six of these beads would buy a beaver pelt. really? and that\'s a high value item. 	S11E13.4
really? and that\'s a high value item. and a bracelet would probably have 40, 50 beads on it. oh. that\'s a small fortune in trade. okay. and it was a great currency for the people that were coming across the atlantic, in particular in nova scotia. it was first the portuguese, and then the spanish, and then the french took over, and the british taking over louisburg. the portuguese were a major trader up and down the american coast, and then the canadian coast at that time. and they would have these barrels of beads that they would trade. which come originally from venice. 	S11E13.4
and they would have these barrels of beads that they would trade. which come originally from venice. we have found some things that pointed to the portuguese possibly being on the island. there\'s even questions on the stone road along the swamp. there are theories that that stone road was built by the portuguese based upon the dates. we\'ve wondered if the portuguese could be involved and they had made it to oak island, but maybe they were over on lot 5 as well and these beads got lost. is it possible that these venetian beads which may be 500 years old or older, could offer evidence that the feature on lot 5 was built during that same time period. 	S11E13.4
500 years old or older, could offer evidence that the feature on lot 5 was built during that same time period. if so, could it also have been constructed by those who created the stone road in the triangle-shaped swamp, and perhaps explain the high-trace evidence of precious metals that had been detected all across the money pit area? if the portuguese were here, these beads could be an indication that they were around the lot 5 area. they might be the depositors of the treasure in the money pit. we don\'t know, but this could be what answers it all. 	S11E13.4
we don\'t know, but this could be what answers it all. here, let me give these back to you. keep them safe. this makes them be more important. yeah, absolutely. lot 5 has become a very prominent point on the island. and it makes you wonder, what else is there? well, this is really great information. agreed. and i want to thank you for your time. oh, you\'re very welcome while jack and charles begin their return journey back on oak island. this was the most interesting area. why don\'t you just start digging? yep rick lagina along with gary drayton at billy gerard continue their search for additional clues along the stone road or shipswarf in the southeast corner of the swamp on the do. 	S11E13.4
their search for additional clues along the stone road or shipswarf in the southeast corner of the swamp on the do. did you see something billy? it looked like a piece right away but i\'m not sure. seems to be a lot of peat in this, there could be some pottery. i think that\'s a rock. not sure. no, that\'s a bit of pottery, mate. and it\'s different as well. it\'s got black edges. so it\'s two-tone. it would have been black and brown. or brown and tan. look, see that darker glaze there? oh, yeah. and it\'s on that side. 	S11E13.4
or brown and tan. look, see that darker glaze there? oh, yeah. and it\'s on that side. yep. i\'ve never seen that before. and i haven\'t, mate. it\'s got the black glaze on both sides. that is different. right. well, put that in the bag, dad, to the collection. i do find the incredible collection of... pottery telling some sort of story and so we need to do our homework. we need to understand what how old this pottery is, what it might have been used for. is there a cultural stylistic understanding of it and then go from there? there we go! 	S11E13.4
is there a cultural stylistic understanding of it and then go from there? there we go! more pottery mate, look it\'s tumbling out. oh here you go gary, here\'s your favorite. there you go. oh that\'s bloody beautiful, look at that. that is really nice. i think this is older than that other porcelain we found. oh yeah, i mean this is really nice. don\'t, that\'s not the same pattern. that\'s an older person. that\'s different. so there was a lot of people here, spent a lot of time right here at the end of this road. and it might span centuries. 	S11E13.4
this is absolutely stunning, mate. that is either a shoe or a boot. while searching for clues near the stone road in the southeast corner of the swamp, rick lagina, gary dream, and billy gerhardt have just made a potentially critical discovery. obviously it\'s leather. it looks like the eel piece. i think that is a eel of a boot or a shoe. i\'d say it\'s the heel, yeah. do you see that square hole there, mate? mm-hmm. and that was made by fastening this sole to the shoe with odd nails, little handmade nails that had square shanks. now, if it was modern, it would be glued. 	S11E13.5
now, if it was modern, it would be glued. so this is an oldie. 1800s or older because now they\'re glued. the sole of a possibly ancient boot found near the stone road in the swamp. but if so, just how old could it be? and who did it belong to? that\'s a very cool find, yeah. if there\'s a certain style to this type of chute, since it\'s close proximity to stone road, you may be able to infer who built the road. i think it\'s important to understand the age of this artifact. i\'m gonna put it in the bag. 	S11E13.5
i think it\'s important to understand the age of this artifact. i\'m gonna put it in the bag. and the dates on the pottery and see what it tells us about the mystery. i\'ll bring it back to the lab. they can conserve it properly. oh, man, i\'ll let you know if we find any more. perfect. good luck. see ya. see ya, mate. later that afternoon... hey, scott. hey, guys. they\'re just above where the tunnel should be on the west side. rick and marty lagina join operations manager scott barlow in the money pit area. they\'re gonna be on an angle for the first hole. 	S11E13.5
they\'re gonna be on an angle for the first hole. judging by the looks of the drill setting. after months of tireless work and unforeseen challenges, representatives from dumas contracting limited have successfully extended the garden shaft to a depth of 90 feet and are ready to begin a core drilling operation in the hopes of penetrating the seven foot high tunnel located just five feet deeper below ground, a tunnel which leads directly toward the baby blob. and a potential cache of buried treasure. hopefully they get some wood in their returns. let\'s find a tunnel for that. let\'s find a tunnel. 	S11E13.5
hopefully they get some wood in their returns. let\'s find a tunnel for that. let\'s find a tunnel. finally, we\'re ready to do the probe drilling down to what we think is the tunnel. what do you got? so we need the data. we need to probe drill first and try and see where this tunnel is and what might be inside it. okay, let\'s just see what happens. start drilling? that\'s enough. i am extremely excited about this because what we find at the bottom of that garden shaft could be everything. the key to this whole mystery might be down there. 	S11E13.5
the key to this whole mystery might be down there. it\'s possible that that\'s where the treasure is. so i mean, we could find it. what does this tunnel represent? it\'s been the focus of the year, you know, does it represent searcher era or, or presearcher era? so fingers crossed, the hope is there\'s a wood core in there and we\'ll send it off. she may not hear anything until the very bottom, until the 95 foot mark. they\'re about there now. what\'s poppin\'? that\'s poppin\'? yeah, it\'s poppin\' bro. yo, i\'m trying to clean up that whole room so i can see it. 	S11E13.5
but if it\'s wood, it can only be the tunnel. it is a potentially critical moment in the money pit area for rick and marty lagina and their team. be about the right depth for the floor of the tunnel. after weeks of frustrating setbacks, representatives from duma\'s contracting limited may have finally reached a seven-foot high tunnel located just below the garden jack at a depth of some 95 feet. a tunnel that runs westward towards an area known as the baby blob, where water testing has detected high trace evidence of gold, silver, and other metals between 80 and 120 feet underground. 	S11E13.6
blob, where water testing has detected high trace evidence of gold, silver, and other metals between 80 and 120 feet underground. the top is balled, but right now we\'ve got seven feet of rock in that hole. well, could be you\'re going through the floor. so that\'s potentially the floor of the tunnel. the floor of the tunnel. hold it up, see what it says. hold it up. i feel like a we\'ll soon know. we\'re about to see what they went through. i mean, sometimes it fails. sometimes you\'ll get a court. but i think we have one. i want to see a good piece of wood. 	S11E13.6
sometimes you\'ll get a court. but i think we have one. i want to see a good piece of wood. that\'s what i want to see. that means that our efforts are worthwhile. i want to see a good piece of wood. that\'s what i want to see. i\'ll show you when you open it. what\'s going there? there\'s a collective sigh of relief. and it confirmed the existence of the tunnel underneath the garden shaft. bingo. they did it. great relief. and we can send it off for c-14 testing. and keep going to see if that will lead to solving a mystery or refining the treasure. 	S11E13.6
and keep going to see if that will lead to solving a mystery or refining the treasure. this whole thing is wood, isn\'t it? that\'s clay, wood. a lot of wood. yeah, it\'s got to be six sections, isn\'t it? could we be one step closer to finding a treasure and if in fact the treasure\'s there? yes. i\'ve been focused for three years now on the metals in the water. we had two preeminent scientists saying these metals are coming from somewhere and it\'s probably very near the garden shaft. so we wanna drill another hole or we wanna just get to digging? 	S11E13.6
so we wanna drill another hole or we wanna just get to digging? i\'d say we drill the north corner, tell you something about the structure of it. zach, it might be a good data point to figure out what it is. it\'s a tunnel to somewhere, it\'s a tunnel for something. it could be original. if that c-14 date comes back, and if it predates search activity, it\'s incredible. if you are looking at a tunnel where people went in to safeguard a secret or treasure, that raises the bar so high, i can\'t even get over it. i mean, look, it\'s been a long summer. 	S11E13.6
i mean, look, it\'s been a long summer. there\'s been a lot of obstacles, but we\'ve proven there\'s wood down below the garden shaft. we found it, right? that was one of the goals, right? and we\'re this far from, well. we\'re going like this far from getting to the top of that. so let\'s figure out what this thing represents. hey, here\'s the deal. right now, we\'re still in the game. if that come up empty, we\'d start to think game is getting bad. we\'re still in the game, so let\'s move on. for more than two centuries, the inability of searchers to recover something of great value in the money pit has caused many to wonder if the oak island mystery was based on mere fantasy. 	S11E13.6
s11e14.1 hey, paul. good morning, guys. how\'s it going? well, we\'re hoping for an update. so, uh, we sent a drone a couple holes. good man. as a new day begins on oak island for brothers rick and marty lagina, they arrive in the fabled money pit area to check on the progress of an operation that they hope will finally reveal the answers to a 229-year-old treasure mystery. it\'s getting close. first hole kind of seemed like it was deflecting off a wall. where are we again? it would be the north side. one week ago, after extending the mid-18th century structure known as the garden shaft down to a depth of 90 feet, representatives from dumas contracting limited used a coring drill to penetrate a mysterious tunnel located at a depth of 95 feet. 	S11E14.1
representatives from dumas contracting limited used a coring drill to penetrate a mysterious tunnel located at a depth of 95 feet. which is believed to run due west toward an area known as the baby blob. it is in this region where water testing that was conducted in previously drilled boreholes has detected high trace evidence of silver, gold, and other metals between 80 and 120 feet underground. there\'s a structure of some sort down there, a wooden structure of some sort, and you\'re about to unearth it, right? that\'s right. okay, that\'s enough said for me. so, today we put in the landing. 	S11E14.1
that\'s right. okay, that\'s enough said for me. so, today we put in the landing. we\'re adding another set. now, after unsuccessfully drilling into the bleached tunnel for a second time, over the course of the next week, dumas will proceed with constructing the final level, or set, to extend the garden shaft down to a total depth of some 95 feet, where they hope to intersect the mysterious passageway and find out what it may contain. we\'ve invested a lot of time and energy delineating this tunnel, and i think there\'s great anticipation on everyone\'s part to try to not only put eyes on it, but to see where it may lead. 	S11E14.1
great anticipation on everyone\'s part to try to not only put eyes on it, but to see where it may lead. if the tunnel predates the shaft, it makes the tunnel far more interesting than just finding a previously unknown tunnel. it\'s all good news. yes, i\'m starting to get eager. all right, let\'s let him get back to work because we\'re poised to finally do this. okey-doke. let\'s go guys. yeah. thanks, paul. okay. thank you, paul. as the operation to deepen the garden shaft continues, we\'re back at it now. yep. h-8. h-8. approximately 60 feet to the southwest, geologist terry matheson and oak island historian charles barkhouse are monitoring a new core drilling operation in borehole h-8, a borehole that was previously excavated in 2017. 	S11E14.1
historian charles barkhouse are monitoring a new core drilling operation in borehole h-8, a borehole that was previously excavated in 2017. this turned into a very, very interesting hole. for a number of reasons. oh my goodness. what is this? after initially recovering pieces of parchment and leather book binding with a 6-inch diameter core barrel in h-8 rick, marty, and their partner, craig tester, speculated that they may have encountered the fabled chapel vault. a seven foot tall treasure chest encased in concrete that frederick blair and william chappell reportedly drilled into back in 1897 and recovered not only evidence of gold but also a piece of parchment bearing the letters vi. 	S11E14.1
into back in 1897 and recovered not only evidence of gold but also a piece of parchment bearing the letters vi. come on, baby. it\'s a big hole. incredibly, when the team expanded h-8 by installing a 60-inch caisson in the fall of 2017, a large object was encountered at a depth of 170 feet. he\'s on something. he thinks it\'s perfectly flat. wood? he thinks wood. unfortunately, as the team drove the aj caisson deeper in the hopes of breaching the vault, the plug, or earthen spoils inside of it, fell out, pushing the potential treasure chest somewhere deeper below ground. 	S11E14.1
the vault, the plug, or earthen spoils inside of it, fell out, pushing the potential treasure chest somewhere deeper below ground. anyway, today, we\'re going back down this hole. all these years later, we did not finish that dig. so it\'s possible that it broke the vault open. so this is going to be a look at the sediments or pieces of the plug, maybe the pieces of treasure, charles. after recent water tests and subsurface scans in this area have offered more evidence of potential valuables. it is rick, marty, and the team\'s hope that if they can pinpoint the possible location of the vault, they will arrange to excavate a much larger diameter caisson in order to recover it. 	S11E14.1
the possible location of the vault, they will arrange to excavate a much larger diameter caisson in order to recover it. the material that fell out of the h-8 caisson had to have migrated somewhere. possibility certainly exists that this is an area to which the chapel vault is falling. it could be deeper and would certainly press on. so anyway, whatever, we\'re in it to win it. we\'ve got to exhaust all possibilities. cross your fingers that we hit the right section and maybe the best section. and hopefully today we\'ll find out where it went. exactly. while the excavations proceed in the money pit area, in the southeast corner of the triangle-shaped swamp located near the center of oak island. 	S11E14.1
proceed in the money pit area, in the southeast corner of the triangle-shaped swamp located near the center of oak island. this is a great day. yeah. that is impressive. that should go the distance. yeah. metal detection expert gary drayton, jack begley, and billy gerhardt are about to conduct a new large-scale dig in a region of the swamp  near the potentially 500-year-old stone road. so we\'re going to be digging in the deepest part of the swamp. yeah. we haven\'t really done a whole lot of work in this particular area and it\'s surrounded by really great finds. 	S11E14.1
we haven\'t really done a whole lot of work in this particular area and it\'s surrounded by really great finds. so with the stone road and stone road, this was a work area, so we got to keep our eyes peeled for anything. right. excellent. well, should we get stuck in? yep. of the many remarkable discoveries that the team has made over the past decade in the swamp, the stone road, or possible ship swamp, may be a critical key to solving the oak island mystery. look at how beautifully constructed. it is not only a near-identical match to a road that rick lagina and members of the team saw in 2021 in alcadao de serra, portugal, where the portuguese sect of the knights templar maintained a stronghold from the 12th to the 17th centuries, this looks old. 	S11E14.1
where the portuguese sect of the knights templar maintained a stronghold from the 12th to the 17th centuries, this looks old. that does, yeah. yeah. but it is also in an area of the swamp where they have unearthed numerous clues, such as a heavy chain with a hook, suggesting the road was created in order to offload some kind of cargo onto oak island. all right. first bucket of opportunity is coming up. now it is the team\'s hope to find more clues that will help explain the true origin of the stone road and hopefully evidence of valuables. oh gosh, smells like treasure. 	S11E14.1
oh gosh, smells like treasure. the southeast corner of the bog is the most interesting location for one simple reason. we want to understand the reason for the construct of the stone road. and if it had something to do with the original treasure story, then that whole area is of significant interest. you guys get back to work. i\'m going to poke a bone in the pile and try to see what i can find. ok, mate. come on, where are you? nothing. look, i\'ve said this many times. i hate that swamp because it stinks. but every time we\'ve dug in it, we\'ve recovered interesting stuff, clues. 	S11E14.1
oh, that\'s a big rock. rick, there\'s something curious about this boulder, unlike other ones in the swamp. it\'s like it\'s sitting on top of the peat, right? which it shouldn\'t be if it\'s glacier, right? so it was moving forward. yeah, i agree. near the stone road in the southeast corner of the swamp, rick lagina and other members of the team have just uncovered a massive boulder that may have been purposely placed into position by someone. but it\'s so by whom and for what purpose? can\'t believe how easy i can move it. the other thing that\'s interesting here is see how it\'s a row of rocks. 	S11E14.2
the other thing that\'s interesting here is see how it\'s a row of rocks. we got this big flat rock and it\'s like a giant set of stone stairs almost here coming up the bank. hard to say. maybe they were doing work around that boulder. yeah. we know the road is there. we know the path is there. we know the money pit is right there. the opportunities are limitless is what could have went on right in this very spot. absolutely. yep. let\'s just gps it. keep digging. a row or staircase of stones leading to the massive boulder in the southeast corner of the swamp? 	S11E14.2
keep digging. a row or staircase of stones leading to the massive boulder in the southeast corner of the swamp? could this feature have been constructed as some kind of symbol or marker? and could it be related to the stone road and perhaps created in order to hide something of great value? i\'m not going any deeper. it\'s as though there\'s some sort of rock platform here. so it\'s not well seeded in the organics and the inference is that it was placed there and not deposited by a glacier. that makes it interesting. i like that. and so my first thought really is we need to find a way to take a look at it. 	S11E14.2
and so my first thought really is we need to find a way to take a look at it. that\'s a board. how deep do you think it was? two feet. yeah, two feet. it\'s out there, though. this is definitely a shaped board. that is thick. check this out, rick. look at the thickness of this. now, this is in good condition, so it\'s got to be a good board. that looks like it could be shipped decking or planking because of the thickness of it. that\'s a big one. but there was no... no, i checked it for fasteners. 	S11E14.2
that\'s a big one. but there was no... no, i checked it for fasteners. no fasteners. it was two feet down, and it was out there. the planks they are finding could be called ship\'s planking. we\'ve found boards that we think might be associated with a ship. that very near vicinity, of course, one of the most enigmatic finds we\'ve ever made is the ship\'s railing from 600 or 700 ad. so that area hopefully will yield some answers. it\'s worth bringing back, washing it off, take a look, see if there\'s anything on it, nail holes or anything. all right. 	S11E14.2
worth bringing back, washing it off, take a look, see if there\'s anything on it, nail holes or anything. all right. we\'re finding more questions in the swamp. every time we\'ve undertaken draining it and digging somewhere, we found something and some meaningful something. but no one knows why these things are in the swamp. it\'s swampy. so yeah, would i like an answer to that? yes, i\'d like an answer to that. simple answer would be i\'m hoping for whatever is there. any metal\'s going to stand out in this stuff. that would be something. all right, let\'s see what we can get done. 	S11E14.2
that would be something. all right, let\'s see what we can get done. later that afternoon, as the excavation and drilling operations continue in the money pit area, near the shoreline on lot 5, located on the western side of the island. wow, you guys have done a lot of work since i last been here. i bet it looks different, doesn\'t it? a lot different. jack begley joins members of the archaeology team as they continue their meticulous excavation of a mysterious stone structure. a foundation that was discovered earlier this year, buried beneath a circular depression. so what\'s going on over here? 	S11E14.2
a foundation that was discovered earlier this year, buried beneath a circular depression. so what\'s going on over here? when we first expanded westward, we thought that this stone line feature was going to continue. we assumed that this was where the house structure sat, and that was just a basement. but it is starting to curve in, which is bizarre. it doesn\'t make any sense. but it\'s too big to be a house. it\'s an occupational spot for sure. in the past year, the team has made significant discoveries in and near this feature that suggest it may have been occupied by multiple groups during different time periods. 	S11E14.2
significant discoveries in and near this feature that suggest it may have been occupied by multiple groups during different time periods. these discoveries include a 14th century lead barter token, which is a compositional match to the lead cross that was discovered at smith\'s cove in 2017. two venetian glass beads, which were not only once considered a form of valuable currency, but which could date to between 1500 and 1650. and several metal tools, which have been scientifically linked to the birthplace of sir william phipps. the english politician and privateer, who some believe buried a large cache of spanish treasure in the money pit back in 1687. 	S11E14.2
english politician and privateer, who some believe buried a large cache of spanish treasure in the money pit back in 1687. so the plan today is to make sure that we define this edge really well. well, we\'ve been finding some really good stuff around here. i can\'t wait to see what else we dig up in here. all right, well, let\'s get to work and see if we can figure out what\'s going on here. while the archaeologists remove spoils or earth from the foundation, jeff is sifting them through a screen for clues that might explain how this feature may be connected to the oak island mystery. 	S11E14.2
sifting them through a screen for clues that might explain how this feature may be connected to the oak island mystery. based upon the different dates, i\'d say this starts to speak more and more to people being on lot 5 earlier. bits of brick and pottery and glass. that\'s pretty cool. hopefully we continue to have more finds and figure out who exactly was here and is it related to the money pit story. thank you. you girls are digging quickly. let us know if we\'re swamping you and we\'ll give you a hand. no, no, no, you\'re fine. i\'m keeping up. 	S11E14.2
s11e14.3 hey, guys. hey, we have another surprise. cool. i can\'t wait to hear your take on this. near the shoreline of lot 5, located on the western side of oak island, archaeologist laird niven arrives at the mysterious stone structure after being informed of a potentially important discovery. all of a sudden i hit this stuff that\'s got a lot of ash mixed into it, crushed up shale and stuff. oh, you can hear it. it\'s like a grayish color and it reminds me of like a crude mortar or cement. oh. the mortar looks an awful lot like the mortar that i found when i was washing through money pit material. 	S11E14.3
the mortar looks an awful lot like the mortar that i found when i was washing through money pit material. oh, really? oh. over the past several years, the oak island team has discovered different forms of concrete in several of the massive caissons they have excavated across the money pit area. a prime example was in 2019, when this type of substance was recovered in the spoils of rf1. a 10-foot diameter caisson located just a few feet northeast of h-8 which was also excavated in the hoax of locating the reportedly concrete-encased chapel vault. we can compare this sample with the money pit sample, see if they come from the same source. 	S11E14.3
we can compare this sample with the money pit sample, see if they come from the same source. i would love to do that. if you could get me a sample, i\'ll take it right back and see what emma has to say. okay. yeah, sounds good. this is a really difficult feature to get answers from because we don\'t quite understand the structure. so we\'re not exactly sure what we\'re looking for. it\'s important for us to take a sample of this soil. it would be interesting to see if it corresponds with the money pit. and if it does, it would suggest that those areas were operating at the same time and were related. 	S11E14.3
and if it does, it would suggest that those areas were operating at the same time and were related. excellent. you\'re doing a great job. i like this. i like what\'s coming up. i don\'t know what it is, but i like it. that part out. okay, i\'ll take this back to the lab. perfect. and check in on you later. all right. i need to get back to safety. the following morning, while representatives from dumas contracting limited continue their efforts to deepen the garden shaft in the money pit area, are we getting our car? here it comes, right now. 	S11E14.3
here it comes, right now. several feet to the southwest. god, i hope something good is in this. marty lagina and his son, alex, join other members of the team at orr hall ha, where they hope to find evidence of the chapel vault somewhere below a depth of 180 feet. it\'s a long one. we\'re ready to slice and dice. we know we had the canister h-8 go down, and it hit something big that moved around underground and went somewhere. we\'re sure of that. yeah, there\'s a lot of water in there. it is possible that h-8 is very near the original money pit, so we have to look deeper. 	S11E14.3
it is possible that h-8 is very near the original money pit, so we have to look deeper. how deep are we, adam? we\'re at 211. it\'s going to be a mess. let\'s get our hands dirty, gentlemen. ready? this is the silt and the clay. there\'s a few little clumps of material that might have fallen from above. there\'s a little chunk of wood right there. it\'s just below all our silt and whatnot. this sits just on top of bedrock. stand right there, charles. come on, be something. we got something. i got something right here. excellent. everyone wash it down. 	S11E14.3
come on, be something. we got something. i got something right here. excellent. everyone wash it down. what is that? oh my goodness. cool. this material to here, that could be part of the plug, no question. the plug could have disintegrated and fallen off to one side and all that stuff. that\'s right, the plug that fell out was nine feet or a little over nine feet. right. and they chewed down one side of it, so we could still get a significant size plug on one side or the other because of the vault. if the team has found a portion of the plot or the spoils that may have pushed the chapel vault deeper underground when the h-8 caisson was originally excavated in 2017, could that mean that they are close to pinpointing the legendary chest of valuables? 	S11E14.3
h-8 caisson was originally excavated in 2017, could that mean that they are close to pinpointing the legendary chest of valuables? hey rick. hey. rick, how you doing? hey. oh, deep are we? well, we\'re at 211 down there. but here\'s the thing, that little bit could have been our plug. because if there was a plug in there, it probably didn\'t stay intact. it probably broke off. well, that and it probably slid the treasure vault to one side or the other. slid to one side or the other, right. so we need to move the rig and come down in another location. 	S11E14.3
so we need to move the rig and come down in another location. i do believe that material, whatever was contained within it, has fallen to a far greater depth. to what side and what cardinal direction, we don\'t know. i think at this point, the only way to exploit this possible clue is to continue to do some drilling. okay, we need to figure out where the next hole is. sounds like a good plan. yep. thanks, guys. later that afternoon, hey, roger. how are you doing? soggy, but otherwise good. come in and sit down, guys. rick and alex lagina, along with scott barlow, joined roger forte inside the dumas trailer in the money pit area, where they are about to receive a carbon dating report regarding a wood sample that was obtained one week ago from the possible treasure tunnel located below the garden shaft. 	S11E14.3
report regarding a wood sample that was obtained one week ago from the possible treasure tunnel located below the garden shaft. we\'re going to call craig and my dad and get the info right from craig. these guys from dumas bought into this process. this is not a job to them. they\'re excited, they\'re interested, they\'re invested. i want to see that somebody\'s been down there a long time. they have a right to know what the fruits of their labor has been. so i hope the results are informative. hey, alex. hey, greg. i got rick, scott, and roger here. 	S11E14.3
s11e14.4 the wood that came up from the garden shaft is from 1631 to 1684. wow. it is a potentially historic moment for rick, marty, craig, and the oak island team. 34% from 1735 to 1803. from 1529 to 1556. good numbers. that is, yeah, that is something. a carbon dating test that was conducted on a wood sample collected one week ago from the possible treasure tunnel below the garden shop has indicated that the seven foot tall structure could be nearly 400 years old. the original searchers, as far as tunneling, wasn\'t until about 1862. yeah, these are pretty impressive numbers. 	S11E14.4
the original searchers, as far as tunneling, wasn\'t until about 1862. yeah, these are pretty impressive numbers. this could be original. so there\'s a chance this is connected to the original money pit. part of the offset chamber. right. incredibly, this is the second wood sample taken from the mysterious tunnel this year that has been dated to as early as the 1600s. this means that it was likely constructed more than a century before the discovery of the original money pit. dates are well, well, well before any searcher should have been in this area tunneling. i think that\'s in everybody\'s vision right now, to deepen that garden shaft and find out what\'s down there. 	S11E14.4
i think that\'s in everybody\'s vision right now, to deepen that garden shaft and find out what\'s down there. you have a tunnel, previously unknown, heading in the direction where these high metal values are being derived. so if this is original work, then you\'re a small step closer to the ultimate solution. we have every reason to continue the process of trying to understand what this tunnel represents. we have to get down there. no, absolutely. and that\'s pretty well our next step where we\'re at right now. it\'s just getting to it, exposing it. i think it\'s going to answer a lot of questions that we have right now. 	S11E14.4
i think it\'s going to answer a lot of questions that we have right now. yep. these results tell me you need to work faster and get better. yeah. well, look, that\'s just a clear victory for today. get back to picking. hope you don\'t. we\'ll let you get to work, roger. very good. thank you very much, gentlemen. great news. the following morning, as representatives from dumas contracting limited continue deepening the garden shaft in order to breach the tunnel at a depth of some 95 feet. hey, billy. hey, guys. ready to keep rolling, mate? keep rolling, gary, i think, yeah. 	S11E14.4
hey, billy. hey, guys. ready to keep rolling, mate? keep rolling, gary, i think, yeah. got a lot of water in the hole, but we can see the rock a little better now. jack begley and metal detection expert gary drayton join billy gerhard in the southeast region of the swamp, just north of the potentially 500-year-old stone road. what is the swamp battle plan today? we\'ll go a little more back towards the road and do the same thing. we\'ll reach out. and then continue back towards the peninsula. all right, we\'ll get ready to get stuck in. okay. hopefully not literally. 	S11E14.4
and then continue back towards the peninsula. all right, we\'ll get ready to get stuck in. okay. hopefully not literally. billy, gary and jack are eager to confirm the potential breakthrough discovery they made two days ago of yet another man-made stone road in the swamp, which appears to be leading toward a massive boulder. this is where the real fun is, gary. yep. see if we get lucky. we have found all of these structures. they imply purpose, intent. to me, there\'s only two trains of thought here to try to explain the why of the structures found in the swamp. 	S11E14.4
me, there\'s only two trains of thought here to try to explain the why of the structures found in the swamp. one, they were ancillary to other work, whether that be in the money pit or elsewhere. or two there was depositional work in the bog proper and these facilitated that work see oh i think we got a bit of planking here oh yeah oh yeah yeah definitely planking look got that like tunneling groove effect going on it yeah wooden planking a siding that looks intentional to me yeah more bits of the ship yeah for sure good eye gary oh look how deep it came out of look on the other side too yeah tug and groove does that go back quite a long time yeah all right, i\'ll set it aside. 	S11E14.4
side too yeah tug and groove does that go back quite a long time yeah all right, i\'ll set it aside. okay, mate. we\'re finding a lot of decking or planks, which is very interesting, because we are actually way out in the swamp. are these planks and these decks part of a mystery ship waiting to be found in the swamp? that would be absolutely unbelievable. they\'re still slopping. i hear clanging. is he hitting rocks? yeah, he\'s got a rock in his bucket. yeah, it\'s a lot of rocks in line with that big rock in the shore, but to the side, there\'s none. 	S11E14.4
s11e14.5 hey, guys. hey, rick. anything? billy feels like he might have found some other structure. it\'s just hard to see underneath the muck. yeah. billy, why don\'t you tell him what you feel like you can feel? it\'s a lot of rocks in line with that big rock. but as you move this way, there\'s no stones at all. yeah. after being alerted that more of a possible stone ramp, which may be connected to a large boulder, has been uncovered in the southeast corner of the swamp, rick lagina joins billy gerhardt, jack begley, and gary drayton to help investigate the curious feature. 	S11E14.5
southeast corner of the swamp, rick lagina joins billy gerhardt, jack begley, and gary drayton to help investigate the curious feature. a little bit of mud on top of them, but they\'re most definitely there. yeah. and this boulder is about the size of some of those other nolan\'s cross rocks. yeah. definitely conical shape. a cone-shaped boulder in the swamp and similar to those in nolan\'s cross? first identified in 1981 by the late fred nolan, nolan\'s cross is a perfectly symmetrical megalithic formation of six boulders near the center of oak island. over the years, numerous researchers have speculated that the cross is a symbol indicating that the hidden treasure includes priceless religious relic, such as the holy grail. 	S11E14.5
speculated that the cross is a symbol indicating that the hidden treasure includes priceless religious relic, such as the holy grail. nolan\'s cross may lead us to a money pit location and where the treasure might be. and others, like architect brian farrell, believe the feature represents a treasure map, which points to the location of buried valuables in the money pit area. you\'ve got to dig on that side of it and this side of it, because then we could shovel it off and take a look. yeah. could this cone-shaped boulder and the possible stone ramp be related to nolan\'s cross? 	S11E14.5
yeah. could this cone-shaped boulder and the possible stone ramp be related to nolan\'s cross? if so, might they represent clues that are connected to high-trace evidence of precious metals that have been detected in the money pit? or could it be related to valuables that are buried in the triangle-shaped swamp? i would like to know definitively that the constructs within this body of the bog are related to the mystery. is it perhaps associated with original depositional work? my hope is that as we excavate the ramp in association with the stone road, we will hopefully find some artifacts that will help with that explanation. 	S11E14.5
excavate the ramp in association with the stone road, we will hopefully find some artifacts that will help with that explanation. it fits all the parameters. it\'s big enough to step on, and it\'s right at the interface between the muck and the water. i mean, that\'s like a nolan\'s cross boulder there. yeah. we may have discovered something really important there, mate. just got to work on it, clean it off. well, it\'s no question it\'s pretty unique. when you see all the digging we did today, there\'s something going on there. so, yeah. yeah. if there\'s a ramp, you know, there\'s a possibility of defining it and looking for artifacts. 	S11E14.5
so, yeah. yeah. if there\'s a ramp, you know, there\'s a possibility of defining it and looking for artifacts. so that might be an aha moment. yeah. so keep digging and see what we see. ok. later that afternoon. thanks, jeff. at the interpretive center. how\'s it going, laird? hey. hey, how are you? you called? it is. rick, his nephew alex, jack, and scott barlow meet with archaeologist laird niven and archaeometallurgist emma culligan for an update on the concrete-like substance that was unearthed two days ago in the stone structure on lot 5. so this is a soil sample. 	S11E14.5
so this is a soil sample. soil that jamie thought was mortar. and it was important enough, we thought, to compare it to some of the mortar that you were getting in the money pit. yeah. and emma has the results of the comparison. great. in order to analyze the believed concrete from lot 5, emma has scanned it with an x-ray diffraction device, or xrd, which uses x-rays to determine the chemical composition and physical properties of materials. so i compared it to mortar samples that i have on file, and it did not match, so it\'s not mortar. and it had some differences to other soil samples collected from lot 5. 	S11E14.5
and it had some differences to other soil samples collected from lot 5. so i ran a comparison to the entire soil database that i have so far. and on the screen, you can see a cluster diagram that i have of the main soil samples. and our sample in that grouping, it\'s an almost exact match to a money pit sample at a depth of 104 feet. wow. that\'s great. so which borehole did this come out of in the money pit? so there\'s a few. c-28, c-18.5, and also the garden shaft. wow. great. amazing. that\'s close to a tunnel below the garden shaft. 	S11E14.5
s11e14.5 ...matches with money pit soil samples found near the garden shaft. great! amazing. it is a potentially critical moment for rick lagina and members of the oak island team. i should point out that the little tiny piece we thought was mortar, but it\'s not natural. so it\'s not naturally occurring, so it must have been replaced there is what you\'re saying? yes. exactly. archaeometallurgist emma culligan has determined that a mysterious type of artificial soil, which was recently unearthed in the stone structure on lot 5, matches others that have been collected by the team some 100 feet deep in the money pit area, and in the same region as the possible treasure tunnel located several feet below the garden shaft. 	S11E14.6
the money pit area, and in the same region as the possible treasure tunnel located several feet below the garden shaft. we were always looking for a connection between lot 5 and the money pit. i didn\'t think you could get it from the xrd. it was an exciting possibility. right, yeah. and if we think about the interpretation that we\'re most interested in, that would be somebody physically transporting the same soil from one to the other, it doesn\'t matter which way. yeah. and this might show that the lot 5 feature was somehow related to the early excavations or the deposit of the treasure. 	S11E14.6
this might show that the lot 5 feature was somehow related to the early excavations or the deposit of the treasure. that\'s the hope. yeah, that\'s one thing we\'ve been looking for on the island is evidence of people staying here while they did the work. we haven\'t found that at all. yeah, you know the last reports that we\'ve got on the wood samples from the tunnel, there is a strong possibility that it was pre-searcher from the 1600s. which would be huge. which would be huge. yeah, those dates do work pretty well with the phipps theory. yeah, absolutely. 	S11E14.6
which would be huge. yeah, those dates do work pretty well with the phipps theory. yeah, absolutely. phipps was in the area. yeah. in early 1687, the english naval captain and politician william phipps recovered approximately 34 tons of treasure in the caribbean sea from the famed spanish wreck known as the concepcion. later that year, king james ii of england knighted phipps for his achievement and ordered him to conduct a second operation to recover the nearly 65 tons of valuables that were believed to remain on the wreck. according to its manifest, phipps made the journey with the help of a freemason from nova scotia named andrew belcher. 	S11E14.6
according to its manifest, phipps made the journey with the help of a freemason from nova scotia named andrew belcher. but curiously, they returned with less than two tons of the riches. i see it as a possible link between the lot 5 and the money pit, and i think we should try to prove it. yeah, absolutely. could alex lagina be correct that the matching soil samples from the foundation on lot 5 and the area around the potentially 17th century tunnel beneath the garden shaft offer evidence that phipps hid the majority of his discoveries from the concepcion on oak island? 	S11E14.6
tunnel beneath the garden shaft offer evidence that phipps hid the majority of his discoveries from the concepcion on oak island? here we have a very interesting connection, i can\'t deny it, with these specific timelines and the significant interest in lot 5. one could make the association to the salvage of the concepcion, and it could change the way we perceive the relationship between lot 5 and the money. but until we get to the bottom of the excavation, i think every possibility is on the table at this point. that\'s why it\'s incumbent on us to figure out what the structure was. 	S11E14.6
that\'s why it\'s incumbent on us to figure out what the structure was. yeah, absolutely. the association that could be made is potentially mind-blowing. let\'s just stay the course and move forward. yeah, okay. all right. thanks, laird. thanks, alan. all right. thank you. see you later. good job. after more than a decade of tireless work and perseverance through numerous unforeseen challenges, rick, marty and their team may be closer than ever to unearthing the answers that many before them were unable to reach. as they dig deeper into the swamp on lot 5 and below the garden shaft, will they finally reveal not only what lies hidden on oak island, but also the truth behind this 229-year-old mystery? 	S11E14.6
thanks for watching! this is one of the reasons why we actually come down. sure. it\'s this relationship, if there is one, between the stone and that little stone walkway, we\'ll call it. as another day begins on oak island, for brothers rick and marty lagina and their team, they are hoping that a recently unearthed discovery in the triangle-shaped swamp might offer new critical clues that will help them solve a 229-year-old mystery. so what are your thoughts upon initial observation? yeah, this feature that bill\'s uncovering, that is very suspicious to me, especially the angularity of the rocks. right. 	S11E15.1
yeah, this feature that bill\'s uncovering, that is very suspicious to me, especially the angularity of the rocks. right. rick, there\'s something curious about this boulder. one week ago, while digging just north of the potentially 500-year-old stone road or ship\'s warmth in the southeast corner of the swamp. the team uncovered what appeared to be another stone walkway leading to a massive boulder. and this boulder is about the size of some of those other nolan cross rocks. yep. curiously, the boulder at the end of the believed walkway bears a striking resemblance to the five cone-shaped boulders that were discovered in 1981 by the late fred nolan, which form a perfectly symmetrical megalithic cross. 	S11E15.1
the five cone-shaped boulders that were discovered in 1981 by the late fred nolan, which form a perfectly symmetrical megalithic cross. i think what we should do is get billy to wash this. mm-hmm. that would help us understand that this is human-made. the why is going to be very difficult. yeah. billy, you\'re up. okay. the team is hoping that geoscientist dr. ian spooner can determine not only if this feature was indeed constructed by man, but also when it may have been created and what sort of function it might have served. there is part of what i call the book about oak island. 	S11E15.1
there is part of what i call the book about oak island. some of those pages are yet to be written about what the swamp holds, what the mysteries are within, and why that work was done. good? that should be fine, just let it drain. okay. i don\'t think you\'ll ever come to a conclusive answer to this mystery without understanding what happened in that bog. what stands out to me is this stone and this stone, this stone and this stone, all in a line when there\'s nothing over to the right hand side. that\'s not natural. i\'m pretty confident it\'s a human-made structure. 	S11E15.1
that\'s not natural. i\'m pretty confident it\'s a human-made structure. what i do know is a rock like this didn\'t come from the beach. and my contention is a lot of the rocks from this came from an excavation, not from a beach. from excavations? like the digging of the money pit. something like formed the mysterious walkway? a geological type that would have come from deep underground? could jack\'s notion that they were placed in the swamp by those who created the original money pit be correct? or since the team has found evidence throughout the swamp suggesting that it may be an entirely artificially made feature, could these rocks have come from a deep excavation that was conducted in order to hide something of great value right in this area. 	S11E15.1
have come from a deep excavation that was conducted in order to hide something of great value right in this area. the more you dig, the more you look in the body of the swamp property, you find human constructs. why are they there? they apply purpose, intent. i do believe that we can connect these dots. hey guys. hey steve. hey tom, good to see you. so what you see is what you see, but i\'ll let the two of you describe what you know. yeah, what we know is the stones are placed by people. mm-hmm. it\'s kind of almost a little bit like a mini stone road. 	S11E15.1
mm-hmm. it\'s kind of almost a little bit like a mini stone road. well, that\'s what i\'m seeing, the similarity. yeah. you have a great elevation, so to me it looks like at least a ramp of some sort. i think the next steps are to leave this, and we haven\'t gone to the other end. we need to continue looking for features. yeah. for now, that shoreline is the most important area. that\'s where people traveled. now let\'s just take a look over there. and we let billy loose and keep digging. sure. let\'s keep digging. and who knows what else we\'re gonna find around here. 	S11E15.1
sure. let\'s keep digging. and who knows what else we\'re gonna find around here. while the investigation proceeds in the triangle-shaped swamp. hey, scott. hey, charles. so where are we today? well, as you can see here, the boys are just working on deepening the shaft here right now. okay. in the money pit area. scott barlow and charles barkhouse are supervising the operation to deepen the mid-18th century structure known as the garden shaft down to a depth of some 95 feet. yeah, a good grab there. yeah. an operation that may soon lead the team to the valuables that people have been trying to find since the treasure hunt began in 1795. 	S11E15.1
soon lead the team to the valuables that people have been trying to find since the treasure hunt began in 1795. they\'re probably within a foot or two above where the top of the tunnel should be. oh. so they\'ve been making good progress. they\'re excited today. i can\'t wait to see it. yeah, you and i both. in the coming days, representatives from duma\'s contracting limited will finish installing the final set in the garden shaft extension where they hope to breach a seven-foot high tunnel that may not only be as much as 400 years old, which leads to an area that has been dubbed the baby blob. 	S11E15.1
not only be as much as 400 years old, which leads to an area that has been dubbed the baby blob. it is in this region where the team has obtained water samples from previously drilled boreholes that indicate a large cache of silver, gold, and other metal objects could be buried between depths of 80 and 120 feet. at this stage, based on what we see, it is quite possible that this is not a searcher meaning a depositor tunnel. and we still have the anomalous metals in the water near the garden shaft. so we have to get to the bottom of that. 	S11E15.1
so we have to get to the bottom of that. shouldn\'t be too much longer before they reset top of the tunnel. let\'s hear what they have to say. hey ronnie, can you hear me? go ahead. how was it down there? we just took a measurement there and after long we had just over 92 feet and i was just okay, well we\'ll let you get back to work. you\'re doing a great job. we\'ll let you know when we get something. we\'re really looking forward to it. thanks. as the search operations continue on oak island, later that afternoon. 	S11E15.1
we\'re really looking forward to it. thanks. as the search operations continue on oak island, later that afternoon. these field trips are usually quite rewarding. absolutely. this is the print shop. scott barlow and oak island historian, doug kroll have traveled some 50 miles northeast to halifax, nova scotia. hey joe. hi. good to see you again. good to see you. here, they have arranged to meet with ancient documents and leather expert, joe landry at dawson print shop to have him examine part of a potentially ancient shoe that was discovered two weeks ago in the southeast corner of the swamp. 	S11E15.1
him examine part of a potentially ancient shoe that was discovered two weeks ago in the southeast corner of the swamp. so we uncovered a stone road, if you will, in the swamp. sure. and this was found just off to the side of it. it was found by rick and gary when they were at their metal detecting. it\'ll be curious to see what joe thinks of this shoe leather. hopefully he can confirm that that is what it is and give us an idea of the age of it. oh, yes. this is hand stitched. it\'s very fine work. 	S11E15.1
oh, yes. this is hand stitched. it\'s very fine work. this is a shoe or light boot, on looks and things. okay. and it would have been a gentleman\'s boot. interesting. yes. does the leather itself tell you anything? well, it appears to be a vegetable tan leather. when you say a vegetable tan, that\'s just basically, they were using a vegetable to color it. that\'s right. that\'s one of the earliest forms of tan-age. oh, really? yeah. can you tell anything from the stitching what age the shoe may have come from? yeah. you\'re talking like 1600s, early 1700s. oh wow, that\'s great. 	S11E15.1
1700s. wow, that\'s very cool. and as you can see, this is amazing, something like this is still intact after all those years. it is well preserved, i\'ll tell you that. at the dawson print shop in halifax, nova scotia. that was beautiful, beautiful work. leather expert joe landry has just given his assessment that the piece of a leather boot, which was recently found near the stone road in the oak island swamp, could date back more than a century before the discovery of the money pit. who would have worn a boot like this? well, it would have been an officer, you know, who could afford a fine boot like this rather than a general crew member. 	S11E15.2
would have been an officer, you know, who could afford a fine boot like this rather than a general crew member. well, i find that very interesting because it speaks to somebody who wasn\'t doing the work, but probably dictating the work. yes, and this, it\'s quite plain to see, was hand-stitched. this would have been more likely done in europe, in prague. oh, really? yes, yeah. it speaks to me of french work, although, you know, it was practiced quite widely. so at this point, we can\'t rule out the portuguese, the french, or the british. they all remain a suspect. 	S11E15.2
so at this point, we can\'t rule out the portuguese, the french, or the british. they all remain a suspect. or even the spanish. i mean, they did find where the works were. joe\'s observations are pointing to a pre-discovery of the money thing. i mean, this is important for the search because we\'re always trying to figure out what to investigate further. it\'s a possibility that this was the toll. what needs further testing. and this lines up with so many of our artifacts. has the team found another critical piece of evidence that could help them narrow in on the identity of those who created the stone road and the recently uncovered walkway and boulder feature in the swamp? 	S11E15.2
on the identity of those who created the stone road and the recently uncovered walkway and boulder feature in the swamp? if so, could it also help reveal who was responsible for the high trace evidence of precious metals that have been detected in the money pit area? we knew when it was leather that you were the man to come and see first. yeah, we really appreciate your input on this. you\'re quite welcome. until next time. that was interesting. doug and scott begin their return journey. miners reporting for duty. back on oak island. the boys are calling you the silver fox. 	S11E15.2
miners reporting for duty. back on oak island. the boys are calling you the silver fox. rick and marty lagina are about to join the operation to help dumas reach the potential treasure tunnel located just below the garden shaft. what are we gonna do? explain to us what we\'re gonna do. so we gotta excavate a little bit more. we gotta chip some of that clay and then we can put another set in. okay. where now is 93 feet. gotta be within two feet then. yeah, somewhere around there. yeah. well, let\'s get suited up and have a go at this, big brother. 	S11E15.2
yeah, somewhere around there. yeah. well, let\'s get suited up and have a go at this, big brother. before dumas can finish construction on the final wooden set that will extend the garden shaft into the tunnel, several feet of hard clay must be removed. it is a task that rick and marty are more than eager to help complete. well, it\'s going to be exciting to go down in that shaft and actually do some digging and maybe be part of unearthing an original tunnel would be incredibly gratifying. all kinds of thoughts are streaming through my head. i mean, you can\'t help it. 	S11E15.2
all kinds of thoughts are streaming through my head. i mean, you can\'t help it. this is an exciting moment. ready? we\'re gonna go down deep into the garden shaft, big brother and i. all set. let\'s go. my brother and i are gonna be miners and our heritage is mining. our grandfather came here in order to work in the mines of michigan. it\'s really an amazing thing that\'s happening here, a confluence of heritage. very good. that\'s right. now we can begin. marty, that\'s going to be your corner over there. that\'s going to be your corner over there. 	S11E15.2
marty, that\'s going to be your corner over there. that\'s going to be your corner over there. okay. yours is called the destroyer. mine is? yeah, yours is the destroyer. all right. you\'ve got to take that seat. cool. well, here\'s the deal, rick. you could be standing a couple feet above the tunnel we\'ve been looking for for at least two years. right there. good. we are. okay, well, let\'s get busy. how do you work this thing? okay. this is about 60 pounds. a little bit at a time. yeah, ok. something going on? silver fox in his brother ready to go. 	S11E15.2
a little bit at a time. yeah, ok. something going on? silver fox in his brother ready to go. there\'s the airline. ordered to break up the hard clay below the shaft, rick and marty are using a pneumatic jackhammer. then representatives from dumas contracting limited will use the three-ton hammer grab tool to remove the materials. the back hammers themselves weigh 60 or 70 pounds. they tend to get stuck in the clay. it is some of the hardest work i\'ve done in many years. alright, break time. i\'m down there. i want to get that clay out of the hole. 	S11E15.2
alright, break time. i\'m down there. i want to get that clay out of the hole. i want to find the tunnel. i didn\'t think of much else to be honest. think you hit? the last spade bit i thought i hit something different. it\'s digging right up there. look at that, it\'s nothing. it\'s really soft. do you have a bar? yeah, right there. i don\'t know if that\'s rock or wood, but it\'s movable right there. come in. i thought at the bottom of the spade bit that i was on top of something, and i thought, wow, wow, maybe i\'m on a tunnel. 	S11E15.2
of the spade bit that i was on top of something, and i thought, wow, wow, maybe i\'m on a tunnel. could rick lagina\'s speculation that he may have reached the mysterious and potentially ancient tunnel be correct? so the team may be closer than ever to the answers and reward that they worked for more than a decade to uncover. there\'s something right there. it\'s that far away. right there is a relative term, right there is a relative term. all right, well, we got it all loosened up for you. is it all the hammer-grab is going to come down? 	S11E15.2
is it all the hammer-grab is going to come down? yeah, the hammer-grab will be not over. wood delineates man-made things, obviously, when it\'s way underground. so we need to keep going. we could be closer than we\'ve ever been to this actual treasure or to where it was deposited. so when we start to go to the tunnel, are you guys going to come down for a day or what? yes. yeah, to try and keep us out. that\'s going to be an experience. that would be cool. we\'ve got to be really cool. we\'ve got to be. discussed today is an alignment that i found by the templars. 	S11E15.2
one, two, three, four. representatives from dumas contracting limited finish extending the garden shaft down to the believed treasure tunnel in the money pit area. so gentlemen, i have no need to introduce chris morford to everyone here. rick lagina along with other members of the team meet once again with author and 32nd degree freemason chris morford in the war room. in recent years chris and his research partner corian mall have assisted the team both on the island and in numerous destinations across europe to investigate the incredible theory that the medieval order of the knights templar and their believed descendants known as the freemasons made repeated visits to oak island between the 12th and 18th centuries in order to find items of great historic and monetary value. 	S11E15.3
visits to oak island between the 12th and 18th centuries in order to find items of great historic and monetary value. i actually look forward to the presentation. i think it\'s gonna be informative and quite interesting. so please proceed. thank you, rick. thank you, everybody. what i\'d like to discuss today is an alignment that i found with nolan\'s cross. now, in light of the team\'s ongoing efforts to locate the source of precious metals that have been detected in the money pit area. so you can see here nolan\'s cross. chris has conducted new research that he believes could help them pinpoint it using the megalithic boulders of nolan\'s cross. 	S11E15.3
chris has conducted new research that he believes could help them pinpoint it using the megalithic boulders of nolan\'s cross. now who placed those stones there as well as why is a question that has been nagging all of us for decades. so i go through the trouble of moving these enormous stones into such an arrangement. i believe this structure was built by the templars and the templars may have used the alignment of nolan\'s cross to guide us to the treasure. this treasure is said to be no less than the holy grail itself. this goes back to the research that corey and i have done. 	S11E15.3
this goes back to the research that corey and i have done. i do believe that the original temple menorah was safeguarded here to make way for the new jerusalem and the new temple. between the 12th and 14th centuries, the military order of the knights templar fiercely battled for christian interests in the middle east and europe during the holy wars known as the crusades. after building their headquarters on the site of the original temple of king solomon in jerusalem, they accumulated vast riches by establishing the world\'s first banking system. however, some believe that their great treasure also included priceless relics that they discovered during excavations beneath the temple ruins, including king solomon\'s golden menorah and the holy grail. 	S11E15.3
included priceless relics that they discovered during excavations beneath the temple ruins, including king solomon\'s golden menorah and the holy grail. in 1307, the order was disbanded and persecuted by the pope and the king of france over controversial charges of heresies. many were imprisoned and executed. however, their believed sacred treasures have never been found. is it possible that some of these relics are buried on oak island as chris norford believes? and could nolan\'s cross hold the key to locating where they are buried? i spent a lot of time wondering what clues would these knights have left for the future brothers to locate the treasure so that their enemies or the uninitiated would not be able to find it. 	S11E15.3
the future brothers to locate the treasure so that their enemies or the uninitiated would not be able to find it. nolan\'s cross couldn\'t be the answer. i needed a first step and the most obvious to me was cone c upon the beach. this would be the only stone visible from a ship. as you leave cone c, of course, you will hit cone a. they actually have a nice sight line to each other and straight to the money pit. but still, you would need markers to help you get from that point to the money pit. because it\'s pretty easy to wander off course. 	S11E15.3
because it\'s pretty easy to wander off course. i saw on some updated maps you have that there were two drilled stones. remarkably. it seems to me they were intentionally put there as markers. yep, we had one on lot 15, and the other one was on the nolan property. well, remember, there was another drilled stone in the money pit area that frederick blair was found. yes. in 1895, treasure hunter frederick blair discovered a mysterious drilled stone in the money pit area. although the stone was moved during future searcher excavations, its original location was marked on a survey conducted by charles roper in the 1930s. 	S11E15.3
was moved during future searcher excavations, its original location was marked on a survey conducted by charles roper in the 1930s. more than three decades later, fred nolan noted two additional drilled stones during surveys that he conducted between the swamp and the money pit. could chris morford be correct that these drilled stones were related to nolan\'s cross and placed as markers in order to help pinpoint the location of the fabled oak island treasure. so when you get to the money pit area, i would think that there was a marker there and then from there you would know where to dig. 	S11E15.3
pit area, i would think that there was a marker there and then from there you would know where to dig. we should get proper measurements and see if we can have it aligned through the money pit, because what are the chances we run into these two drilled stones right through cone a and cone c? maybe we can project where the money pit was. that could be highly relevant. chris, do you believe that templars or descendants or versions of the templars came and did the work here? either is plausible. it\'s so romantic to think that the templars come to this tiny nondescript island. 	S11E15.3
either is plausible. it\'s so romantic to think that the templars come to this tiny nondescript island. they do this incredible amount of work. and then chris has taken that to help put an x on the ground on oak island, it doesn\'t prove anything, but the line created by cone c, the drilled stones, and cone a may ultimately assist us in finding the original money, and that\'s the goal. i certainly believe that research is a huge component to figure out what happened here on this island long ago. so the debt of gratitude lays on our heads and our shoulders to you. 	S11E15.3
so tom, i suppose you wonder why we asked you to come out today, right? well, i know roughly where we are here as i look at that. exactly, cone c of nolan\'s cross. following their meeting with 32nd degree freemason chris morford, rick lagina and steve guptill, join fellow oak island landowner tom nolan on his property at cone c, the northernmost boulder near the shoreline which marks the so-called left arm of nolan\'s cross. we had a theorist come, chris morford, you\'re quite familiar with him. he made association between cone c, cone a, drilled stones, and aligned it to the money pit. 	S11E15.4
he made association between cone c, cone a, drilled stones, and aligned it to the money pit. wow. it is rick\'s intention to have steve, a professional surveyor, track the line from cone c through several drilled stones, as well as cone a of nolan\'s cross, and finally, to the money pit area where chris morford believes the precise location of the fabled oak island treasure may be buried deep underground. okay, let\'s go. we\'re all excited. we want to measure it ourselves. we want to walk the line. hopefully we corroborate what chris has suggested. we have to find out where it goes, specifically in the money pit. 	S11E15.4
hopefully we corroborate what chris has suggested. we have to find out where it goes, specifically in the money pit. alright, so this is our first drilled stone. yep. and for reference, i\'ll tag it again. okie dokie. all right, let me take you to cone a. okay. so i\'m going to do my best to actually walk the line. as we walk that line, we know the elevation will change. that\'s the reason for the drilled stones. the purpose is to draw an alignment between cone c and perhaps the location of a treasure. all right, so we all know this is cone a. 	S11E15.4
all right, so we all know this is cone a. yep. i\'m going to tag it and then calculate the next point. okay. thank you. all right, go to there. follow me through. okay. so i\'m currently on the line. through here. yep. as we walk the line, we\'re getting closer to the money pit. i\'m excited to see where it goes. so here\'s the next drilled stone. it\'s right online. can i just see that? sure, ken, i\'m gonna tag it while i\'m here. you see how they would have turned the chisel. yes, as they were going. so here\'s an observation. 	S11E15.4
you see how they would have turned the chisel. yes, as they were going. so here\'s an observation. this is the exact path point from cone c in the water to lot 15. and the next half is the money pit. so this is almost perfectly half the distance. what are the odds of that? i don\'t know. for christian to make this observation and then have these measurements play out as they are, quite remarkable. really is. i\'d be very curious if it\'s half again the measurement to the money pit. let\'s find out. follow me. it\'s quite remarkable that drill stone on lot 15 is exactly halfway from cone c to the money pit. 	S11E15.4
it\'s quite remarkable that drill stone on lot 15 is exactly halfway from cone c to the money pit. so now what we need to do is walk the other half to the money pit. so the next stop is our end point. so i\'ll take you to the end point. okay. watch your step here. the final location, or the other half of the distance from lot 15, is right here. oh my goodness. as you can see, it\'s not perfectly on the shaft, but what it isn\'t on top of is the tunnel. really? yeah. wow. the bingo point, if you will, is almost exactly where the tunnel under the garden shaft is. 	S11E15.4
really? yeah. wow. the bingo point, if you will, is almost exactly where the tunnel under the garden shaft is. now that\'s quite remarkable. that\'s pretty close. pretty close. that\'s pretty darn close. but to have that line based on two of the stones of nolan\'s cross and two drilled stones land on that corner of the garden shaft, that\'s dramatic. now we have to expose the bottom of the structure and exploit that information. we have to come to a further understanding of what this tunnel potentially represents. yep. we\'re a ways from that yet. yeah. but for right now, there\'s a lot of work to do. 	S11E15.4
yep. we\'re a ways from that yet. yeah. but for right now, there\'s a lot of work to do. so let\'s get to it. okay. sounds good. as the operation to deepen the garden shaft continues in the money pit area. i\'m really interested to see what we dig up over here as we continue digging along the stone road. yeah. jack begley, along with gary drayton and billy gerhardt are proceeding with their excavation to the north of the newly uncovered stone walkway or ramp. let\'s go. yeah. where they hope to find additional evidence of man-made structures and very valuables. 	S11E15.4
let\'s go. yeah. where they hope to find additional evidence of man-made structures and very valuables. what a source of that! that\'s a big stump. it\'s a big tree. makes you wonder how big the trees used to be. yeah. i took a big fella to get this down. this is giving me hope. every time i see a trunk like that coming out, that means the woods, the forest was more in there. like dr. spooner said, this did not used to be a swamp. nope. it used to allow trees to grow. exactly. the stump of a tree unearthed from the deepest area of the swamp, because trees cannot generally grow in bodies of water. 	S11E15.4
stump of a tree unearthed from the deepest area of the swamp, because trees cannot generally grow in bodies of water. the team has found more evidence to support dr. ian spooner\'s belief that the swamp was at least a partially man-made feature. no, no metals. we\'re metal-less. but the wood more than makes up for it. it\'s about the context and the wood was found at the very bottom of the swamp and it wasn\'t thrown in later. this is, this is wood from a very old source. if dr. spooner can successfully date this storm. could it help the team confirm when the swamp was artificially created? 	S11E15.4
if dr. spooner can successfully date this storm. could it help the team confirm when the swamp was artificially created? billy, this was perfect timing, mate, getting these interesting pieces of wood out. we know that that storm\'s coming from down south, and we are gonna get drenched. you can feel it. the air is changing. you see, i mean, the swamp\'s gonna fill up for sure. those stumps are pretty unique. we should get wrecked down here to take a look at them. oh, we will. yeah. yeah, great work, billy, mate. see you later, mate. coming up. there\'s something going on there. 	S11E15.4
what a glorious day of being in the swamp rick. new day, fresh dig. as another day dawns on oak island. rick lagina has joined gary drayton and billy gerhardt to continue their investigation near the middle of the triangle-shaped swamp. there might be a story here that we\'re standing on and don\'t even know it. yeah. all right, let\'s find some good stuff. because a heavy overnight rainstorm has partially refilled the swamp,  the team is now excavating several feet to the north of where they discovered a large tree stump and possible evidence of ancient human activity just one day ago. 	S11E15.5
the north of where they discovered a large tree stump and possible evidence of ancient human activity just one day ago. pulling up another stone. that layer there, that\'s a change, a significant change. how did it go from forest land and when to the deep water cold? i think it might prove when somebody did something here. yeah. we know that, according to dr. spooner, and certainly the evidence is there, that at one point the swamp was forested. now the key question is, was that manipulated? hopefully dr. spooner can provide us with some answers. trunk in a notch there or not even like it was actual? 	S11E15.5
spooner can provide us with some answers. trunk in a notch there or not even like it was actual? if that broke off, the logs would be laying right there beside it, i think. oh, absolutely. right? and it\'s not... it\'s not there. and it\'s just not there. somebody took the logs. yeah. oh yeah. for something, maybe to build a money pit. could billy gerhardt be correct that long ago, trees were removed from this area when it was dry land? in order to construct the nine wooden platforms of rounded logs that were reportedly discovered more than two centuries ago in the original money pit. 	S11E15.5
the nine wooden platforms of rounded logs that were reportedly discovered more than two centuries ago in the original money pit. yeah, i don\'t know. we need dr. spooner to weigh in. yeah, sure. to see if he can date when that event happened. yeah. okay, for right now, i\'m going to take off. you guys are in charge. hopefully you\'ll find some more things. okay, mate. thanks, billy. yep. good luck. as gary and billy continue their excavation for answers in the swamp. it seems like we hit your target, finally. we found her. yeah. ha ha ha. rick likina, scott barlow, and craig tester have just received long-awaited news. 	S11E15.5
we found her. yeah. ha ha ha. rick likina, scott barlow, and craig tester have just received long-awaited news. after extending the garden shaft to an approximate depth of 95 feet in the money pit area, representatives from duma\'s contracting limited have finally reached a believed seven foot high tunnel that leads toward the baby blob and perhaps a vast cache of buried treasure. can actually see wood. okay. but it\'s either collapsed or whatever, who knows what. yeah. yeah. till we uncover more of it. okay. get us dressed, let\'s get going. okay. hey. finally, we can actually put eyes and boots on the tunnel that was found by the sonic drill program. 	S11E15.5
hey. finally, we can actually put eyes and boots on the tunnel that was found by the sonic drill program. you get a little bit of chills. let\'s go take a peek. it\'s been frustratingly slow at times, but it\'s exciting. good luck, guys. take your picture. thanks. if it was original, it\'s our belief that we\'re talking hundreds of years ago. whoa. now that raises the bar. there\'s hope, there\'s promise. you might find the one thing. so i think there are some answers here. okay, so what are we looking at here, paul? so that\'s where we got the sample out of the wood. 	S11E15.5
exciting, right? something there though. it is a historic and exciting moment for rick and marty lagina, their partner craig tester and their entire team. you got the crowbar right behind you? here, go right. at the bottom of the garden shaft in the fabled money pit area, a wooden tunnel that may lead to a legendary cache of buried treasure has finally been reached at a depth of some 95 feet. you know, there\'s something going on there. definitely wood. there\'s a wrong log right? you can see the end. hear that? isn\'t it so hollow? yeah. listen to that. 	S11E15.6
there\'s a wrong log right? you can see the end. hear that? isn\'t it so hollow? yeah. listen to that. that\'s one of the beams. this beam is not hollow like that. there\'s only so much you can see between the clay and the water. but it\'s real, and that\'s the important part. there\'s a wood structure down there, and at that point it becomes, okay, can\'t stop now. if you want to expose more of it, you can add one more section, and then go deeper, that\'ll give us another 32 inches. you have to go deeper. absolutely. the board this way, if you pound on it, it sounds hollow to me, like there\'s empty space below that. 	S11E15.6
the board this way, if you pound on it, it sounds hollow to me, like there\'s empty space below that. right. and that would be, to me, that would be indicative of the top of the tunnel. we did probe the logs that were there. in line with the projection it seemed hollow underneath. hit that one timber it\'s on hollow to me yeah and the hope is to extend the shaft to explore this further. it\'s exciting seeing round timbers down there. to me, round timbers are a great indication it\'s potentially old. you have to go back to the original story, right? 	S11E15.6
you have to go back to the original story, right? you know, logs every 10 feet in the money pit. logs, that\'s the description. it\'s an interesting possible connection. round timbers associated with the original construct of the money pit and round timber here. when i look back and think about reading the reader\'s digest article, it does bring your mind back to round logs in the original money pit, round logs in this feature. and so i don\'t have to believe that we\'re making progress and solving the mystery. i know we are. if we only saw square timbers down there, i think we\'re more into more modern searcher times. 	S11E15.6
if we only saw square timbers down there, i think we\'re more into more modern searcher times. so we\'ll just square off the excavation and we\'ll add another section on top. then we\'ll be ready to dig for another three feet and we\'ll be right on top of the structure. i mean, you can\'t help but let your mind go on this. after 15 years we may be just a few feet above original work. it could be it. it could be the thing. i am very excited that this is going to lead us to a treasure. yeah, it\'s gonna be, it can be quite a day when we set eyes on it completely. 	S11E15.6
yeah, it\'s gonna be, it can be quite a day when we set eyes on it completely. let\'s get it done. let\'s figure out what that tunnel represents, right? yeah. and where it\'s going. we\'re gonna find that hidden tunnel. it\'s right below us. i think we need to get out of there, wade. i think so. you guys stay safe down here, okay? okay. drop by. for rick and marty lagina, what began as a childhood dream may soon be fulfilled by a discovery that could rewrite history as we know it. to the ultimate answers of just who and what was behind the oak island mystery, lie at the end of a mysterious tunnel below the garden shaft. 	S11E15.6
oh, this is a perfect day to be in the swamp, isn\'t it? yeah. this is a deep part of the swamp here. yeah, it\'s complicated too. and that\'s exactly why you\'re here. to uncomplicate this for us. despite the ominous weather, as a new morning begins on oak island, the hope for a breakthrough discovery that could help solve a 229-year-old mystery remains far from dampened for brothers rick and marty lagina and their team as they continue investigating near the middle of the triangle-shaped swamp. bill, can you fill us in on what you\'ve seen here? what we\'re seeing is we have a high layer of stumps. 	S11E16.1
what we\'re seeing is we have a high layer of stumps. trees wouldn\'t grow that big unless the environment was somewhat dry. we could probably take a cut through there, a cut through here. we\'d probably find more. okay. it\'s a beautiful section to understand how this area developed. so why don\'t we see if we can expose one. all right, let\'s step back. that\'s a big stump. one week ago, while excavating in this deep region of the brackish bond: it\'s all uneven like it was at the cut. members of the team uncovered several ax-cut tree stumps. if that broke off, the logs would be laying right there beside it, i think. 	S11E16.1
if that broke off, the logs would be laying right there beside it, i think. curiously, because trees are unable to grow naturally in swamp environments, these finds offered critical evidence to support the belief of geoscientist dr. ian spooner that the swamp could be an artificially made feature. there\'s your layer of stump there. and there\'s a big something. now, as the team unearths more potentially ancient stumps from the middle of the swamp, dr. spooner will collect samples for c-14 testing in order to hopefully determine just when this area of the swamp was created. so the question, i think, for me is whether or not those stumps stayed out the same as the paved area. 	S11E16.1
so the question, i think, for me is whether or not those stumps stayed out the same as the paved area. remember, we found wood that dated at 1,200 within the paved area. in recent years, the oak island team has uncovered numerous stone structures in the swamp. these include the potentially 500-year-old stone road and the stone walkway leading to a massive boulder in the southeast corner, as well as a massive paved area in the middle of the bog that dr. spooner was able to carbon date to approximately 1200 ad. these discoveries have made rick lagina believe that the oak island mystery may be connected to a generational conspiracy that was carried out in stages over a number of centuries. 	S11E16.1
oak island mystery may be connected to a generational conspiracy that was carried out in stages over a number of centuries. what happened here? obviously the stumps can be dated and hopefully those dates will align with the manmade constructs that we have found. stone roads, stone road, paved area, because we have retrieved dates from those. we need to do our homework and be patient. i think there are some answers here. if we get dates 1200 on those logs at the bottom, that would equate to the paved area. that means that there\'s a forest at this location at that time. 	S11E16.1
that means that there\'s a forest at this location at that time. so, yeah, at this stage, what we\'ve got to do is get dry weather to actually effectively sample this. yeah. well, all i know is good luck with the dry weather. yeah. we have a hurricane on the horizon and a bad weather this weekend. yeah. hurricane lee is on the near horizon heading towards nova scotia. no need of a hurricane visiting the island. the potential problems are quite extensive. we don\'t know how impactful it will be. will it be a category one, a tropical storm, category two, three, four? 	S11E16.1
will it be a category one, a tropical storm, category two, three, four? we\'ll have to wait and see. i\'m just going to grab my tools, get some sample bags so we can get these samples. yep. yeah, this will be very interesting to see what happens here. while dr. spooner collects his samples in the swamp. hey scott, little bit of excitement around here. yeah, so the boys have actually now found the wood that we\'re looking for. in the money pit area, scott barlow meets with roger forte of dumas contracting limited for an update on an operation that the team hopes will soon lead them to a vast cache of buried treasure. 	S11E16.1
for an update on an operation that the team hopes will soon lead them to a vast cache of buried treasure. from the pictures i saw from ronnie, it looks like those timbers are pretty old. they\'re all rounded out. it really motivated the guys to say that once they saw that, they were just like tunnel rats down there. they were moving clay like you wouldn\'t believe. you get a visual on it. definitely would. you see the end. last week, after nearly two years of tireless effort, the team from dumas was finally able to extend the mid-18th century structure known as the garden shaft down to a depth of 95 feet, where they exposed the top of a bleak, seven-foot-high wooden tunnel. 	S11E16.1
the garden shaft down to a depth of 95 feet, where they exposed the top of a bleak, seven-foot-high wooden tunnel. a tunnel that runs due west into the so-called baby blob, where water testing in previously drilled boreholes has identified high traces of gold, silver, and other metals between 80 and 120 feet underground. in the coming days, the team will install one additional section or set to the base of the garden shaft to breach the tunnel and find out not only where it leads, but also what it might contain. this is all about anticipation. i mean, we\'re close. 	S11E16.1
this is all about anticipation. i mean, we\'re close. we have physical evidence that the tunnel is real. it\'s been a long process, almost two years worth of effort between the planning and the execution and ultimately the successful completion of the task at hand. now we need to understand its relevance to the mystery. we\'ve got a lot to learn from this tunnel. sounds good. see how it goes. who can have an anxious to get down there? alright. right on. don\'t you have to get up there? yeah. we\'ll talk to you later. as the operation continues in the garden shaft, later that afternoon. 	S11E16.1
yeah. we\'ll talk to you later. as the operation continues in the garden shaft, later that afternoon. good day. good day, sir. hello, dr. sutowsky. welcome to the war room. we really appreciate you coming to us and we look forward to what you have to say. thank you for having me. i\'m really happy to be here and share these exciting results with you today. yep, our pleasure. rick, marty, craig tester and other members of the team have gathered in the war room for a meeting via video conference with dr. spooner\'s colleague, geoscientist dr. aaron sutowsky. today we\'re going to learn about a new science and new data and the doctor was kind enough to run some analysis specifically about where certain artifacts came from. 	S11E16.1
science and new data and the doctor was kind enough to run some analysis specifically about where certain artifacts came from. exactly. over the past several years, between the team\'s core drilling operations and the installation of a number of large steel caissons all across the money pit area. they have recovered evidence of two potentially man-made chambers outside of the baby blob that also contain traces of precious metals. one is located some 180 feet deep in a large void between boreholes h-8 and rf1 where a possibly ancient pickaxe was also recovered and the other was found at a depth of approximately 150 feet which the team has dubbed aladdin\'s cave. 	S11E16.1
also recovered and the other was found at a depth of approximately 150 feet which the team has dubbed aladdin\'s cave. dr. sutowsky, please proceed. okay, so isotope tracer work is slightly more nuanced than other type of analyses that might be done. now, after conducting isotope testing on wood samples that were unearthed from these locations. dr. sutowsky has prepared a report that he believes could offer new clues to help the team solve the oak island mystery. the main isotopes that i wanted to focus on are the strontium and the oxygen isotope composition in the wood samples that you sent. 	S11E16.1
that i wanted to focus on are the strontium and the oxygen isotope composition in the wood samples that you sent. so strontium is a metallic element that can be used like a fingerprint in combination with oxygen to identify where objects come from in the world. wow. it\'s kind of interesting. yes. so if we look at the money pit samples, so these two samples, 0328 and 013, came from rf1. yeah, that\'s where it gets really interesting, because rf1, we still believe, was closest to the original money pit. yep. the next slide i have is the isotope values, so we can really look at the data. 	S11E16.1
yep. the next slide i have is the isotope values, so we can really look at the data. and what you can see is we\'re measuring oxygen and strontium in the wood samples that i\'ve plotted here. so these two wood samples, o328 and o13, they both plot in a very similar spot. these samples, i would argue, are the most interesting samples that we have. they plot furthest away from maritime canada and northern canada. so, our only option is europe. that\'s really interesting and baffling. so where do you think that sample comes from? southeastern france, northern italy, or, you know, coastal norway, in those areas, that\'s where it overlaps. 	S11E16.1
our only option is europe, southeast france, northern italy or you know, coastal norway and those areas that\'s where it overlaps. that sounds good enough to me. good enough? sounds very good. sounds remarkable. in the war room, geoscientist dr. aaron sutowsky has just shared a stunning scientific report that the wood recovered nearly 180 feet deep from borehole rf1 in the money pit area, likely originated in europe. a lot of old looking timber came out of that caisson. you know, it\'s really interesting to note that the areas that dr. sutowsky are giving us for the possible origin of these samples is southeastern france. 	S11E16.2
sutowsky are giving us for the possible origin of these samples is southeastern france. the idea that the mines where the lead for the lead cross came from, is in italy. i mean, we saw a lot in italy that we feel could relate to the oak island mystery. yes. when we went to viterbo, jean-luc had told us that a lot of holy relics came from jerusalem through italy, and then off to other regions like france. buongiorno. over the last decade, as rick, marty, craig and the team have been digging into both the ground and the past in their efforts to solve the oak island mystery. 	S11E16.2
the team have been digging into both the ground and the past in their efforts to solve the oak island mystery. they have visited numerous sites in both france and italy. hey guys, come take a look at this. that served as strongholds between the 12th and 14th centuries for the knights templar. it is the belief of numerous researchers that members of this medieval christian order were the ones who carried out a generational conspiracy to hide vast riches and priceless religious relics on oak island. hey rick, check this out. that\'s cool. we have seen this symbol before. a joe stone. 	S11E16.2
hey rick, check this out. that\'s cool. we have seen this symbol before. a joe stone. yeah. in addition to seeing many stone carvings on these journeys that were identical to symbols that have been found over the last two centuries by searchers on or near oak island, astonishingly in 2017. the team also unearthed a lead cross on the island itself, made from lead that was scientifically traced to a 14th century mine in southern france. those are really provocative locations considering everything we found on the island and everything we\'ve been researching. is it possible that the team has found more evidence right in the money pit area that the templar order really could be connected to the oak island mystery? 	S11E16.2
more evidence right in the money pit area that the templar order really could be connected to the oak island mystery? this has opened our minds to the possibilities of even revisiting the areas that these samples have been retrieved from, like rf-1. i think it puts a renewed interest in that location. yeah, back to back we go. we just need to go deeper. even though we\'re in the garden shaft, even though we\'re drilling around the 95 foot tunnel and the baby blob, this information is exceedingly important because you have incredibly interesting samples from rf1. and you have some clarity about where they might have come from. 	S11E16.2
and you have some clarity about where they might have come from. different geographic regions associated with templars. could it possibly reflect multiple treasure depositions? it may change the search agenda as we currently understand it. thank you and we look forward to our next communication. absolutely. i look forward to it. thank you. the following day as the operation to breach the possible treasure tunnel continues in the garden shaft. f175-8.25. that\'s what we expected. fast tail all the way down to 88 feet. more than 50 feet to the southwest. hey guys. we never did get to the bottom. 	S11E16.2
more than 50 feet to the southwest. hey guys. we never did get to the bottom. marty. hey marty. how you doing? what\'s going on today? well, we\'re trying to get to the bottom of rf-1. oh, okay. marty lagina joins other members of the team where a new borehole known as f175-8.25 is being drilled within the previously excavated 8 foot diameter rf-1 caisson in the hopes of finding additional clues and hopefully evidence of valuables. the key to this whole drill program or this endeavor is to get down and see what\'s between 205 and the bedrock. yes. the initial results drilling of the original rf-1 were very interesting. 	S11E16.2
yes. the initial results drilling of the original rf-1 were very interesting. all kinds of things that made me think at the time we were in the original money pit. but we did stop somewhat short of the bedrock. there\'s like 10 feet or 15 feet of material we never got to. so we\'re going to sort of re-drill rf1 to see what we might have missed with the canister. maybe this re-drilling rf1 would give us a place to put down a canister that goes even deeper. we need to find the best target because we are running out of the usual things. 	S11E16.2
we need to find the best target because we are running out of the usual things. money, time. so, okay, in place. steve, i know you have to go and i got some stuff to do too. we\'ll be back. okay, guys. thank you. see you later. as the core drilling operation proceeds in the money pit area, on lot 5, located near the shore on the western side of the island. we have a hurricane on the way, so let\'s try to get as much work done as we can, and then we\'ll see what we can do after the hurricane\'s passed. 	S11E16.2
to get as much work done as we can, and then we\'ll see what we can do after the hurricane\'s passed. gary! all right. metal detection expert gary drayton joins jack begley, jamie kuba, and fiona steele as they continue investigating the large foundation that was discovered earlier this year beneath a circular stone structure. we\'re trying to figure out why they brought deep money pit soil in and packed it into this portion of the wall. like at 104 feet down. that\'s crazy. yeah. since the team purchased lot 5 and began searching for clues in this feature one year ago, they have made astonishing discoveries that include metal tools and various kinds of pottery. 	S11E16.2
clues in this feature one year ago, they have made astonishing discoveries that include metal tools and various kinds of pottery. a lead barter token that is a compositional match to the 14th century lead cross. it reminds me of like a crude mortar or cement. and a man-made cement-like substance that has also been found approximately 100 feet deep around the tunnel below the garden shaft. gary is going to scan the rocks and spoils that have recently been removed from the feature and i got the big coil on so depth is not a problem in order to look for more clues as to how it might be connected to the money pen. 	S11E16.2
not a problem in order to look for more clues as to how it might be connected to the money pen. whoa, that sounds great. we have got an it right in the top hear jack. do you want me to dig it out or do you just want to pinpoint it? yeah, i\'ll try pinpointing it. that sounds really good. that is not iron, that\'s non-ferrous. let\'s see what we got. what we got waiting for us. yep, that\'s it in my hand. right in my hand. oh make sure that is it. yep and i see the edges of it mate. 	S11E16.2
oh, i see what it is, mate. oh, a nice little button. oh, wow, look at that. that is really, really nice. is that silver? i think it could be, mate. it\'s either silver or pewter. i mean, look at that. you can see the shine on it. oh, yeah. while metal detecting the spoils from the mysterious stone structure on lot 5. that ain\'t copper alloy. no. metal detection expert gary drayton and jack begley have just unearthed a potentially important clue. that\'s a great find. yeah, that is sweet. mm-hmm. there\'s a chance this could be silver mate meaning treasure. 	S11E16.3
that\'s a great find. yeah, that is sweet. mm-hmm. there\'s a chance this could be silver mate meaning treasure. this is great and the thing is it\'s fancy. we find a lot of cuff buttons, especially around here, but none as fancy as this. this might have been an officer\'s button. based on it being a flat button, what period of time were flat buttons in use? mid 1600s all the way through into the early 1800s. that\'s brilliant. great find, gary. yeah, just here. all right, i\'ll bag it. i love the buttons. it\'s an oldie. this can still tell a story. 	S11E16.3
all right, i\'ll bag it. i love the buttons. it\'s an oldie. this can still tell a story. let\'s find some more artifacts, mate, because that was really, really cool. oh, we\'ve got another non-ferocity. that is gonna be something good. should be able to pinpoint it. i see something here, mate. oh, it\'s got a design on it. it does. it\'s three cannons. is it? it is. it\'s not. it\'s artillery. yes, it is. it\'s a cuff button and a military button, mate. can we see? yeah. come on over. ladies, come and check this out. think we got ourselves a military button. 	S11E16.3
can we see? yeah. come on over. ladies, come and check this out. think we got ourselves a military button. that was fast. look at this. this is special because it is artillery. that was on a uniform. as far as dating it, it\'s a flat button. so we\'re in the 1700s, maybe even older with this. yeah, that\'s absolutely correct. oh, here you go. wow. i\'m pretty sure it\'s three cannons, and then there\'s three dots along the base. sweet. i know artillery buttons were popular with the french, the british, and the spanish. that\'s awesome. this could tell us not only a who, but a when. 	S11E16.3
that\'s awesome. this could tell us not only a who, but a when. on not just who did work on lot 5, but who was deep down in the money pit, digging, i\'m thinking depositing something before the money pit discovery. and if the military was here, then this could change what the entire feature is understood as. i say we get this back, along with the other button back to the lab. see you soon. see you, gary. yay! great job. as the operations in the money pit area continue. emiliano, thank you for joining. yeah, yeah. dr. spooner has done a lot of work in the swamp off of the peninsula. 	S11E16.3
yeah, yeah. dr. spooner has done a lot of work in the swamp off of the peninsula. rick lagina has called a meeting with his brother, marty, and researchers, judy rudebush and emiliano zacchetti, who joins via video conference. here\'s some results. although he was unable to attend the meeting early this morning, dr. ian spooner presented rick with a carbon dating analysis that he conducted on the tree stumps that were recently found in the swamp. there appears to be two levels of stumps. this is fairly definitive. it\'s meaningful because the stumps were cut. and we believe, i certainly do, that human beings went in there and harvested the trees there because we find no logs, none. 	S11E16.3
believe, i certainly do, that human beings went in there and harvested the trees there because we find no logs, none. and all the stumps are roughly this high. so dr. spooner pulled a sample from one of the stumps at the lower level for c-14 analysis to determine when the tree was actually cut down and used. so here\'s some results from data analytics. 54.1%, 1346 to 1396, and 41%, 1296 to 1328. let\'s get wood from 178. well, that\'s deeper than normal. yes. so where did it come from? we\'ve got nothing but bad news. we\'re going to have to shut down. 	S11E16.3
64.1% 1346 to 1396. 14th century. and 41% 1296 to 1328. in the oak island research center, rick lagina has just revealed an astonishing c-14 report, which suggests that the axe-cut tree stump that was found in the middle of the triangle-shaped swamp could be more than 700 years old. this is meaningful if it came from a bona fide... it did. well, if it\'s from a cut stump, then somebody cut it. we\'re coming to believe that the swamp was artificially manipulated. and we know from dr. spooner\'s work on the paved area, that construct is 1200. rick, you\'ve come to the belief that there\'s been substantial periods of activity here, daisy-chaining each other with gaps. 	S11E16.4
rick, you\'ve come to the belief that there\'s been substantial periods of activity here, daisy-chaining each other with gaps. this would support that. this would very much so. i think it\'s appropriate at this point in time that we build off of what professor gaspani told us last year in terms of nolan\'s cross, right? one year ago, during their visit in italy to investigate possible connections between the medieval order of the knights templar and the oak island mystery, rick, along with members of the team and researcher emiliano zacchetti, met with archaeoastronomy expert professor adriano gaspani. the position where the star comes out changes in the centuries. 	S11E16.4
the position where the star comes out changes in the centuries. based on professor gaspani\'s more than three decades of expertise, the megalithic formation of six boulders on oak island, known as nolan\'s cross, was likely created centuries ago by positioning the massive boulders on the surface to align with specific stars in the night sky. and by studying the historic positions of those stars, professor gaspani was able to calculate the approximate date when the cross may have been created. the alignment of these stars bring an epoch of 1200 ad. we have professor gaspani\'s assessment that someone who\'s here in the 1200s building something. 	S11E16.4
we have professor gaspani\'s assessment that someone who\'s here in the 1200s building something. now we have other human activity that dates to the same time frame. it\'s very possible then that human beings were here. what is being understood by these processes is that the work in the swamp perhaps did start very, very early, i.e. 1200s. and if that is the point of beginning, it opens up the door to all kinds of possibilities in terms of theory and the who, what, when, where, why, and how things. there was a determined effort on the part of groups to conduct some enterprise here that it may have been done incrementally. 	S11E16.4
was a determined effort on the part of groups to conduct some enterprise here that it may have been done incrementally. it stretches the mind to think that something was that important to have been done over centuries. so in order to properly, i\'ll say, utilize professor gaspani\'s expertise and his knowledge, i think it\'s an imperative on our part that we expand upon that information. and one of the ways we can do that, in my opinion, is we know there are two other stone constructs on the island. the stone triangle and the stone cairns is what fred delineated on his map. 	S11E16.4
the stone triangle and the stone cairns is what fred delineated on his map. he called them pirate piles. in 1897, treasure hunters were astonished to discover an equilateral triangle composed of beach stones located on the south shore, which pointed due north toward the original money pit. while the feature\'s exact position was plotted on numerous surveys, unfortunately, it was later destroyed during the massive digging operations conducted by robert dunfield in 1965. however, the remnants of several other man-made stone structure remain, nearly a half mile to the northeast on lot 15. first documented by fred nolan in the 1960s, the so-called stone cairns, or pirate piles, were five pyramid-shaped constructs that fred believed pointed directly toward the triangle-shaped swamp. 	S11E16.4
1960s, the so-called stone cairns, or pirate piles, were five pyramid-shaped constructs that fred believed pointed directly toward the triangle-shaped swamp. what\'s left up there? refresh my memory. very little. the features themselves, the bases of the features are there. i think we should provide professor gaspani with gps coordinates for the stone cairns and the stone triangle, and ask him, can you make any alignments to the stars? rick, i couldn\'t possibly agree more. i\'m wholly on board with this. let\'s do it. could rick\'s notion be correct? that if professor adriano gaspani analyzes the positions of the stone cairns and the stone triangle. 	S11E16.4
that if professor adriano gaspani analyzes the positions of the stone cairns and the stone triangle. that may be able to determine just when those features were originally created. so if you guys provide me some data, some measurements, i\'m more than happy to share it with professor gaspani as soon as i see him. we\'ll send you on the information asap. please thank him up front for all of his work to date and we look forward to continued interaction with him. that\'s great. thanks again. perfect. hi craig? no gold? not yet. in the money pit area, craig tester joins geologist terry matheson and oak island historian charles barkhouse as they continue monitoring the core drilling operation in borehole f175-8.25. 	S11E16.4
joins geologist terry matheson and oak island historian charles barkhouse as they continue monitoring the core drilling operation in borehole f175-8.25. how deep are we? we\'re down 178 so far. we hope to follow it all the way down to the bottom, craig. but we\'ve been in and out of a little bit of wood, and that wood we have right there, that came from 155 and a half to 157. right. yeah. and we did get a little bit of wood from 178, too. oh, that\'s deeper than normal. yes. so where did it come from? possible evidence of a wooden structure? 	S11E16.4
oh, that\'s deeper than normal. yes. so where did it come from? possible evidence of a wooden structure? unearthed at a depth of 178 feet? could it be related? to the wood sample previously recovered from this area, which originated in europe. if so, what else might they find as they drill deeper underground? hey pvc pipe. f175-8.25, down, 199. it\'s discouraging the idea that we\'re passing through an old borehole. unfortunately, the fact that the drill has encountered fragments of pvc pipe means that it has veered off target and into a previously drilled borehole. but just what did the drill hit that changed its course? 	S11E16.4
hey roger. hey, how\'s it going alex? good, good to see you again. before another productive day comes to an end on oak island. i think we\'re just coming down on the tunnel, right? well, exactly. alex lagina arrives in the money pit area for a progress uptake on the operation to extend the garden shaft into the possible treasure tunnel located more than 95 feet underground. so right now the shaft bottom is at 95 and we dug about 2.5 feet, so i\'d say 97-98 feet. so we just finished installing the staging in there to make it safer for the guys. 	S11E16.5
so we just finished installing the staging in there to make it safer for the guys. yep, that looks like part of the shoe going down now, is that right? that\'s right, yeah. so they\'ve got the two panels, the two end panels that go on the wall plates. we\'re going to add a shoe section to it. so what we\'re trying to do is stop anything from coming in. right. it\'s like building a ship in a bottle. yeah, it is. that\'s a good metaphor. in order to safely extend the garden shaft to the top of the mysterious tunnel, the team from dumas is constructing and installing a protective steel and wooden frame known as a shoe, which will secure the base of the structure into the earth around the tunnel and protect it from caving in. 	S11E16.5
shoe, which will secure the base of the structure into the earth around the tunnel and protect it from caving in. so we\'ve got a couple of days of just getting all that stuff done and then we\'ll be back into digging. the best case scenario is if the tunnel is open. yeah. it might lead us to the money pit and the treasure. i mean from the look of what i saw in that dibra, it looks pretty original. it looks old? oh yeah, it\'s definitely not something that came out of a mill. right, and all of it means we\'re a step closer to finally actually visually seeing some of these structures that have been underground for hundreds of years. 	S11E16.5
we\'re a step closer to finally actually visually seeing some of these structures that have been underground for hundreds of years. well, exactly. well, we\'re all anxious and we\'re all excited and we all appreciate the work you guys are doing. all right, absolutely. and i\'ll let you know as soon as i see something in there that looks like, okay guys, you need to come and see this. sounds good, perfect, thank you. right on. see you soon. absolutely, we\'ll talk to you later. thanks everybody for coming around the war room table today and we\'ve got nothing but bad news. 	S11E16.5
thanks everybody for coming around the war room table today and we\'ve got nothing but bad news. rick lagina has called an emergency war room meeting with members of the team. hurricane\'s coming, there\'s no denying it. the problem with hurricane lee that i see for the island is the speed that the storm is moving. in this storm the directions are going 360 degrees and wind right so everybody is going to feel a piece of it. 24 hours hurricane lee has rapidly intensified into a category 5 storm system with wind speeds that could exceed 150 miles per hour after already causing damage to bermuda and the northeastern united states it is now projected to reach the atlantic coast of nova scotia in the coming days bringing with it torrential rains flooding and potentially grave danger to the province. 	S11E16.5
coast of nova scotia in the coming days bringing with it torrential rains flooding and potentially grave danger to the province. so, and then we just cross our fingers and hope that, you know, all goes well, that we stay safe here and that everyone in the area stays safe. and if anybody in the local area needs help, you know, and they ask for help, they should know that we\'ll be there for them as well. yeah. so. we\'ve all been here during this storm before 2019. i think we all remember the waves breaking over the causeway. you\'re right. 	S11E16.5
i think we all remember the waves breaking over the causeway. you\'re right. yeah. there\'s no road under here. four years ago, hurricane dorian battered oak island and the surrounding areas, which severely damaged the causeway and structures across the island. with hurricane lee now fast approaching, the team is fearful of the damage it could cause, not only to the ancient structures in the swamp and on lot 5, but also to the garden shaft. this could be the most dangerous day on this island. yeah, exactly. the possible negative effects on the search agenda are quite extensive. this swamp will refill and we will be delayed. 	S11E16.5
the possible negative effects on the search agenda are quite extensive. this swamp will refill and we will be delayed. we know that there\'s been a problem with water intruding within the garden shaft. trees come down, power is lost. it affects everything. i don\'t know where to go with this discussion to be honest with you. i think pretty apparent. we\'re gonna have to shut down. we\'re gonna have to stop all the activities to keep everybody safe. i mean, they\'re shutting down each night when it might rain, and then this is completely different. this is the first time in war room history that i\'m gonna say this, and i don\'t want to be here. 	S11E16.5
i don\'t see anything helpful about hurricane lee. in the war room, rick lagina and other members of the team are regrettably planning to temporarily shut down all search operations on oak island. due to reports that hurricane lee, a category 5 storm system, will reach the eastern coast of nova scotia in a matter of days. bottom line is, first and foremost, everybody be safe. yes. the next thing that\'s paramount of course, making sure that we try to protect the work that\'s already been accomplished. keep all the infrastructure that\'s in place up and ready to function when the good weather comes back. 	S11E16.6
keep all the infrastructure that\'s in place up and ready to function when the good weather comes back. yeah. so laird, why don\'t we start with you? so you\'ll take care of your sites, all your tools, everything. yeah, exactly. all we can do is batten down our two sites with tarps so we can just protect them as much as we can, but there\'s very little we can do to prevent water getting in them. we\'re just gonna be eyes and boots, guys. you need us help. we\'re at your disposal to say, you go do this, you go do that. 	S11E16.6
you need us help. we\'re at your disposal to say, you go do this, you go do that. and roger, you\'re up next. what do you do? on our side, it\'s not so much the wind, it\'s the amount of rain. that rain, obviously, we\'re in a hole. water goes down the hole. so it\'s gonna be like niagara falls down there. we\'re gonna put the lids on. we don\'t want the water to fill up in the shaft and go up to a height that\'s maybe gonna cause us grief. and we\'ll have a couple of guys here keeping the water down, just pumping out every two hours, start the pumps and let the water go down. 	S11E16.6
guys here keeping the water down, just pumping out every two hours, start the pumps and let the water go down. you know, really, not much you can do about water and swamp. no. probably my biggest concern is for the island overall. we have a couple sections of the swamp road that are still narrow. so we have to make sure that those are shored up because we want to make sure that the ocean doesn\'t reach. no, the island doesn\'t take too much of a pounding because we don\'t want to continue to lose shoreline. but it\'s going to be the wind. 	S11E16.6
but it\'s going to be the wind. it\'s going to be a big thing here. so we\'ll cover the whole island, and we\'ll just go area by area. just one other thing from the big rain we had months ago. it washed out a lot of roads. this storm may wash them out again. so even if you\'re thinking about the island, you\'re driving here. there\'s a number of places where this road\'s been undercut and they can give out on you. so really watch out for that when you\'re coming back. yeah. if you don\'t need to be up during the storm, stay home. 	S11E16.6
yeah. if you don\'t need to be up during the storm, stay home. i guess we do have a full day ahead of us so we should get started. get some stuff done. sounds good. everybody stay safe. yes. there\'s no question that safety is paramount. you can\'t do anything about mother nature. what you can do is say, you know what? we\'re gonna deal with these issues and we\'re gonna keep moving forward. and that\'s what we intend to do. you can see this web of colors in the night. i\'d certainly been a top seat tour of the year. 	S11E16.6
you can see this web of colors in the night. i\'d certainly been a top seat tour of the year. bad luck happening right at the right time where it hampers your efforts. i don\'t believe in curses, but here we are in the garden shaft. maybe only feet above some real answers. alright guys, we\'re good to go! i don\'t know why mysterious setbacks seem to occur at very inopportune times, but they do. ah, it\'s just incredible, isn\'t it? and it seems to be when you\'re close to the treasures when it becomes really impossible. let\'s get going. for rick, marty, craig and their team, what\'s the way to do it? 	S11E16.6
s11e9.1 time to drain the swamp. do it. the swamp holds secrets to the mystery. oh, no. oh. that\'s interesting. what do you got? holy crap. it seems like jewelry. a symbol found on templar churches pointing directly to oak island and is believed to represent the holy grail. oh. if there\'s gold in that void, that\'d be huge. there\'s something there. there is an island in the north atlantic. where people have been looking for an incredible treasure for more than 200 years. so far, they have found a stone slab with strange symbols carved into it, man-made workings that date to medieval times, and a lead cross whose origin may be connected to the knights templar. 	S11E9.1
it, man-made workings that date to medieval times, and a lead cross whose origin may be connected to the knights templar. to date, six men have died trying to solve the mystery. and according to legend, one more will have to die before the treasure can be found. how\'s it going, guys? what have you got for us today? the guys are down there right now, so we identified a water source. it looks like it\'s confined to one space. ok. an especially anxious morning has begun on oak island for brothers rick and marty lagina and their team as they work to solve a 229-year-old mystery. 	S11E9.1
begun on oak island for brothers rick and marty lagina and their team as they work to solve a 229-year-old mystery. so quite a bit of water, we\'re looking at about 250 gallons a minute. and i think that\'s our biggest problem down there. right. we want to look. absolutely. that\'s absolutely. i\'m ready. sounds good. let\'s go. all right. in the money pit area, representatives from dumas contracting limited believe they have finally identified the location where a mysterious inflow of water has been flooding the 87-foot deep mid-18th century garden shaft for nearly two weeks. what remains unknown is if it may be related to a legendary man-made flood tunnel that was reportedly triggered during an excavation of the original money pit back in 1804, and which has thwarted the efforts of treasure hunters ever since. 	S11E9.1
an excavation of the original money pit back in 1804, and which has thwarted the efforts of treasure hunters ever since. it\'s a long, bloody way down, you know? now, rick and marty are descending the garden shaft themselves to inspect the cavern and the mysterious inflow of water in order to help dumas not only identify what each feature may be, but also decide how to achieve their ultimate goal of extending the garden shaft down to a depth of some 95 feet, where they hope to breach a 7-foot-high tunnel. a tunnel which runs westward towards an area known as the baby blob, where high traces of gold, silver, and other metals have been detected between 80 and 120 feet deep. 	S11E9.1
the baby blob, where high traces of gold, silver, and other metals have been detected between 80 and 120 feet deep. ok, here we be. i believe now we can see where the water\'s coming from. source of the water. do you think it is all right here? i would say 80% that\'s where it\'s coming from. we will be sealing up the source of the water with multi-urethane. if you stop the source, then we can see when it\'s passed out and build voids and everything like that. without this water coming in. yeah. now that the team from dumas contracting limited has identified the source of the water, over the coming days, they will attempt to seal it using an industrial-grade compound known as multiurethane that expands when wet. 	S11E9.1
over the coming days, they will attempt to seal it using an industrial-grade compound known as multiurethane that expands when wet. if you look in here, turn your light on good, you\'ll see the big boy. in there, there\'s a, it\'s like a little cavern. one week ago, while dumas was searching for the water source at a depth of nearly 65 feet, their team also discovered a strange cavity just outside the shaft containing wooden timbers. and in the same general area where last year, a sample of wood from the garden shaft was found to contain high trace evidence of gold. 	S11E9.1
area where last year, a sample of wood from the garden shaft was found to contain high trace evidence of gold. i think that we were all quite interested in what this cavity void represents. we have spent a lot of time to try to follow the golden and silver. if there\'s gold in that void, that\'d be huge. that cavity might prove to be very interesting. what about the wood that we heard was in there? some of it\'s still there, and some of it\'s at the bottom of the void, i guess. oh, yeah, i do see it. how far in is it? 	S11E9.1
oh, yeah, i do see it. how far in is it? here, take a look. this looks like a little grotto. what is it, about three feet back there? four feet, maybe? yeah, it goes back and up. there\'s a board right there. you got it. you come here, you. how about that then? that\'s from the original shaft. i don\'t see enough wood to represent some other construct. i think at this point, it\'s probably associated with the original shaft construct. there are some pieces of wood in there. they don\'t look ancient to me. i think whoever dug the original garden shaft, as they were going down, might have needed a little bit of work room. 	S11E9.1
think whoever dug the original garden shaft, as they were going down, might have needed a little bit of work room. that\'s what i think we\'re looking at. so more importantly, we have the metals in the water by the garden shaft. and the metals are inclusive of gold and silver. so the next thing that has to be done in the garden shaft is we have to get control of this water. ok, we sort of got two issues going here, right? we got this water. yeah. and then we got this issue over here. but we know on the outside of the old shaft, we found traces of gold. 	S11E9.1
but we know on the outside of the old shaft, we found traces of gold. ok. yeah, we got some good samples here. we got a piece of wood from the cavity. our job here is done. as representatives from dumas continue their work in the garden shaft, later that morning. billy. i was hoping you\'d leave some work for us. rick and marty join billy gerhardt on the south shore road, bordering the triangle-shaped swamp. it\'s that time of year again, isn\'t it? time to drain the swamp. yeah. having just acquired a government permit, the team is ready to drain the brackish water from the swamp to search for clues that may be critical to solving the oak island mystery. 	S11E9.1
drain the brackish water from the swamp to search for clues that may be critical to solving the oak island mystery. so what\'s the plan, rick? you know, i avoid all things swamp. well, i think the swamp holds secrets, but i don\'t know where they are, to be honest with you. yeah, i think i\'m more excited about the swamp, probably, than i have been to date. really? yeah, because we have the ships railed. you know, we got the road, we got the path, a ton of stuff, and we\'ve only done one of the three sides. yeah. in addition to ancient coins, ship pieces, and fragments of cargo barrels. 	S11E9.1
yeah. in addition to ancient coins, ship pieces, and fragments of cargo barrels. in recent years, rick, marty, and the team have uncovered a number of stone structures, such as a road or ship\'s wharf near the south shore road. i\'m most interested in what lies at the end of the stone road. if it\'s a slipway, that\'s important. if it\'s a wharf, it\'s important. so if i started anywhere, it would be the stone road. once the area is drained, billy will help the team excavate the south shore road in the hoax of finding definitive answers of who built the massive stone structure and if any evidence of valuables remains hidden nearby. 	S11E9.1
hoax of finding definitive answers of who built the massive stone structure and if any evidence of valuables remains hidden nearby. when are you going to start that bad boy up? well, i think i did lots of times, so one of you guys should have the honor. big brother, let\'s get going. in accordance with environmental regulations, rather than pumping the water into the ocean, it will be diverted several hundred yards away to the center of the island. time to drain the swamp. do it. get out of here. drain the swamp. as the swamp begins to drain, on lot 5, located on the western side of the island. 	S11E9.1
drain the swamp. as the swamp begins to drain, on lot 5, located on the western side of the island. i just want to get this level done. ok. alex lagina and members of the team are carefully excavating a circular stone structure that has been determined to set atop a much larger foundation. oh. huh. that\'s cool. that\'s really cool. it\'s a little tiny ring. wow. hey, guys, you want to come take a look at this? sure. sure. it seems like jewelry, but very tiny jewelry. yeah. what do you got there? check that out. oh, yeah. so there\'s no way to determine a time period on this as we sit here right now? 	S11E9.1
oh, yeah. so there\'s no way to determine a time period on this as we sit here right now? no. this a good find? since they began investigating this feature one year ago, the team has been perplexed by the number of potentially important clues they have found. that\'s really cool. which span a number of eras prior to the discovery of the money pit. these include mid-17th century pottery, a believed 14th century lead barter token, which may be related to the lead cross that was unearthed at smith\'s cove in 2017. and a number of metal tools that have been directly connected to the 17th century privateer, sir william phipps, an english nobleman who some believe buried a vast cache of silver and gold in the money pit back in 1687. 	S11E9.1
s11e9.2 lot 5 of oak island. you mind if i take a look? archaeologist jamie kuba has just discovered a possible clue in the mysterious foundation that was found beneath the circular stone depression. interesting. any idea what this might have been used for, if it is decorative? i would think maybe on, like, a wooden door or something, maybe a chest. that\'d be exciting. yeah, that would be exciting. yeah, it\'s very cool. we\'ve got this building that\'s a little too big to be just a residence. i\'m just going to throw this out there. privateering? yeah. it\'s not out of the realm of possibility at all. 	S11E9.2
i\'m just going to throw this out there. privateering? yeah. it\'s not out of the realm of possibility at all. there was a lot of privateering in this area during that time frame. there\'s so much evidence of that already here, so why would this island not be a part of that to some degree? yeah. we need way more evidence of any kind to say anything for sure. well, the metal pieces that came out of this unit actually was metallurgically connected to phipps\' birthplace. right. and of course, you know, phipps, we know, found the concepcion. in 1687, the english politician turned privateer and treasure hunter sir william phipps was ordered by the king of england to conduct two salvage operations of the famed spanish galleon wreck known as the concepcion, which sank off the coast of the dominican republic in 1641. 	S11E9.2
of the famed spanish galleon wreck known as the concepcion, which sank off the coast of the dominican republic in 1641. curiously, during the second recovery mission, which was carried out with the help of a high-ranking freemason from nova scotia named andrew belcher, phipps delivered less than 10% of what remained on the wreck according to its manifest. we know that phipps found silver on the concepcion. this documented fact led scott clark, a 32nd degree freemason, and the author of oak island odyssey, a masonic quest, to share his theory with a team in 2021 regarding the whereabouts of the missing valuables. 	S11E9.2
island odyssey, a masonic quest, to share his theory with a team in 2021 regarding the whereabouts of the missing valuables. i believe some of the treasure from the concepcion was secreted to oak island. that is remarkable. yeah. so phipps may not have sent all of the silver back to england. so there is that theory that maybe he hid some of it here. right. because the team has already found several metal tools that have been scientifically connected to sir william phipps in this feature on lot 5, could jamie be correct that they, as well as this decorative metal piece, offer compelling evidence that sir william phipps could really be connected to the oak island mystery? 	S11E9.2
as this decorative metal piece, offer compelling evidence that sir william phipps could really be connected to the oak island mystery? look, they\'re great finds, but i think they\'re enough to get us started, but they\'re not enough to get us there, right? yeah. we\'re finding cool things, so i\'m sure there\'s going to be more. yeah. the following morning. ok, ray, so we should be able to keep an eye on them down there, right? yeah. man, look at that water. marty lagina arrives in the money pit area to monitor the ongoing effort to stop the flooding in the garden shaft using a sealant known as multiurethane nearly 65 feet below ground. 	S11E9.2
ongoing effort to stop the flooding in the garden shaft using a sealant known as multiurethane nearly 65 feet below ground. we\'ll get the urethane mix ready to go. i just want to just try and get as much pumped in there as fast as we can. ok. the hope is that we\'re going to pump this foam into there. yep. it\'s going to expand up to 20 times its size, and it\'s going to fill that void and seal the water up. ok, here we go. start pumping. coming on. just like surgery. scalpel. come on, guys. you can do this. 	S11E9.2
ok, here we go. start pumping. coming on. just like surgery. scalpel. come on, guys. you can do this. while the work continues in the garden shaft. later that morning. gentlemen, i don\'t think our guest needs any sort of introduction because we all know scott clark. marty joins his brother rick and other members of the team to welcome author and 32nd degree freemason scott clark back to the war room. in light of the recent discoveries made on lot 5 that have been connected to sir william phipps, scott has asked to share more information about phipps\' personal assistant, andrew belcher, that may further help prove his incredible theory. 	S11E9.2
scott has asked to share more information about phipps\' personal assistant, andrew belcher, that may further help prove his incredible theory. andrew belcher has been a person of interest for a long time. he\'s very likely one of the very earliest freemasons in north america. i believe that the belcher family knew about oak island from connections through freemasonry. based on stunning discoveries that have been made in recent years on oak island, including structures such as the paved area and the stone road in the swamp, along with a tunnel running below the garden shaft, and artifacts like the lead cross and a red garnet stone, which have all been scientifically dated to between the 12th and 17th centuries. 	S11E9.2
the lead cross and a red garnet stone, which have all been scientifically dated to between the 12th and 17th centuries. welcome to the templar city. rick, marty, and their team have been carefully investigating the theory that the medieval order of the knights templar and their believed descendants, the freemasons, carried out a generational conspiracy to hide not only vast amounts of gold, silver, and jewels in the money pit area, but also priceless religious objects so i\'ll get into my presentation. great. my current research involves a really important map that i found in the archives of canada from 1762, which i believe has masonic ciphers encoded in the map. 	S11E9.2
map that i found in the archives of canada from 1762, which i believe has masonic ciphers encoded in the map. and i found evidence that they could strongly tie with the knights templars. really? yep. so the map that i\'ve been referring to was created in 1762 by nova scotia\'s chief surveyor and early freemason, charles morris. so that\'s actually the whole map itself. so this is the very earliest map, i believe, of mahome bay that shows oak island. so when morris actually surveyed mahone bay back in 1762, he would have been asked to do so by his boss at the time, nova scotia\'s lieutenant governor, jonathan belcher, jr., the grandson of captain andrew belcher, who worked directly with sir william phipps. 	S11E9.2
time, nova scotia\'s lieutenant governor, jonathan belcher, jr., the grandson of captain andrew belcher, who worked directly with sir william phipps. jonathan belcher, jr. was also the masonic grand master of the provincial grand lodge of nova scotia. no kidding. quite remarkable, right? so morris, in 1762, surveyed mahone bay, which is the same year that the islands divided a lot. yeah, by him. by morris. yes. yeah. so the map was made by the guy that divided the island into lots. definitely, yes. yeah. of the more than 350 islands found in mahone bay, oak island was the only one chosen to be divided up into four-acre lots in 1762. 	S11E9.2
islands found in mahone bay, oak island was the only one chosen to be divided up into four-acre lots in 1762. is it possible that charles morris was directed to do this by jonathan belcher, jr., because of belcher\'s secret knowledge of what was hidden there? so as i was studying this map, it occurred to me that the a in mahon had this v-shaped crossbar, which was different than the a in bay, with a much more normal straight crossbar. so that\'s the a with a v-shaped crossbar. and according to templar researchers in portugal, the a with a v-shaped crossbar is believed by a number of people to represent the holy grail. 	S11E9.2
researchers in portugal, the a with a v-shaped crossbar is believed by a number of people to represent the holy grail. is that right, charles? is that true? yes. researchers have suggested that these a symbols with a v-shaped crossbar look very similar to the masonic compass and square logo, which was later adopted by freemasons. and knowing that morris was a freemason, my first thought was that he was encompassing masonic compass and square. so i quickly realized that the masonic script a was pointing directly up to oak island 33 years before the discovery of the money pit. and you think that he had an idea that treasure was already on the island? 	S11E9.2
s11e9.3 this map was made since it was before the discovery of the money pit, that he had an idea that treasure was already on the island. for sure he did, yes. in the war room, 32nd degree freemason scott clark has just presented a map of mahone bay that was created in 1762 by charles morris, the high-ranking freemason who divided oak island into four-acre lots that very same year. and curiously, scott believes the map contains secret symbols indicating that sacred religious treasures of the knights templar are buried on oak island. so at first, i thought this masonic strip day in mahon was the only one. 	S11E9.3
so at first, i thought this masonic strip day in mahon was the only one. but as i kept looking, i discovered three more in the name st. margaret\'s bay on the far right of the map. by utilizing those three small a\'s in the name st. margaret\'s bay. if you created a circle on the map using the exact arc created by the three masonic script a\'s, the circle will not only pass directly through the compass rows of the map, but also directly over oak island. it seems clear that morris actually knew the secret before anyone outside of the depositors knew that oak island was special. 	S11E9.3
it seems clear that morris actually knew the secret before anyone outside of the depositors knew that oak island was special. did morris do any other maps? i mean, is that the only map that he has those a\'s? he did other maps, and i\'ve never seen that same a from him. and those same symbols i found on templar chapels and churches. so within the church of santa maria de olaval in tomar, portugal, we find the tombstone of walden pays, who was the fourth grand master of the knights templar in portugal. there is an a symbol with a v-shaped crossbar, which i\'ve highlighted in red. 	S11E9.3
there is an a symbol with a v-shaped crossbar, which i\'ve highlighted in red. a very similar symbol, a symbol with a v-shaped crossbar, can be found carved into the convento di cristo, or convent of christ, that belonged to the knights of christ, also in tomar. there is also an a symbol with a v-shaped crossbar carved into a pillar... yep. ...within the santa maria nuova church in viterbo, italy. mm-hmm. saw it, right? i\'ve seen all this so far. over the past two years. hey, guys. this symbol is definitely on the 90-foot stone right there. that\'s perfect. yep. 	S11E9.3
over the past two years. hey, guys. this symbol is definitely on the 90-foot stone right there. that\'s perfect. yep. rick, alex, and other members of the team have visited numerous sites in both portugal and italy that were known strongholds for the templar order between the 12th and 16th centuries. wow, that\'s incredible. you think speechless? you see this. and in all of these locations. h-i-c. which in latin means here. including those just noted by scott clark. they have seen symbols, artifacts, and even structures matching others that have been found over the years on oak island. the stone road looks exactly like this. 	S11E9.3
the stone road looks exactly like this. yeah, it looks the spitting image. just to recap, it seems clear that morris actually knew from his masonic connections that there was already some sort of deposit on oak island. this certainly provides some tantalizing clue. yeah, for sure. all theories are unique, but with scott\'s, he actually has a document, the charles morris map. through his research into masonic symbolism, he has made some connections there. i mean, we\'ve always been confounded that charles morris, the surveyor general, surveys oak island, and yet there were, at the time, 300-plus islands in the bay, and they weren\'t surveyed. 	S11E9.3
surveyor general, surveys oak island, and yet there were, at the time, 300-plus islands in the bay, and they weren\'t surveyed. we know the history of masonic association with the island, and that there was some sort of interest or some sort of knowledge about the importance of the island. it\'s an incredibly interesting theory. the story of what might have happened here long ago scott, thank you. i am always amazed how many things can possibly be related to oak island through history. and yet, it\'s plausible. so we thank you for coming here. and don\'t be a stranger. thanks, guys. 	S11E9.3
and yet, it\'s plausible. so we thank you for coming here. and don\'t be a stranger. thanks, guys. the following day. hope we can get the water to stop. as members of the team continue their work to stop the mysterious flooding inside the garden shaft. hey, billy. hey. good day. rick and alex lagina, along with metal detection expert gary drayton, join billy gerhardt at the south shore of the swamp. we\'re going to do a dig past the stone road to see the extent of it. it\'s something you\'ve always wanted to do. now that some three million gallons of brackish water have been pumped out of the bog, they are eager to once again investigate the stone road. 	S11E9.3
gallons of brackish water have been pumped out of the bog, they are eager to once again investigate the stone road. i\'m hopeful we\'ll be finding all kinds of good stuff. and where are you going to put all the artifacts? in the back of my car. i\'ll start scraping some gravel off. as billy carefully digs, gary drayton will scan the spoils for any important clues or evidence of valuables. we may find a feature or features under the swamp road that may indicate why the stone road was constructed. i\'d like to know every last bit of information that the swamp can give us, and hopefully that information goes towards the greater goal of solving the mystery. 	S11E9.3
s11e9.4 hey, uncle rick. sure. while excavating the swamp near the potentially 500-year-old stone road. that\'s it? yeah, that\'s it. rick lagina and the members of the team have just made a curious discovery. it looks like a dowel. yep. when i saw it, you know what it reminded me of? the dowels in the u-shaped structure. yeah. it\'s just about how big they were. yeah, they were huge. there\'s a log right there. here\'s a pig right here. is it? a pig. in 2018, rick, marty, and the team unearthed a mysterious feature at smith\'s cove that was originally discovered by dan blankenship in 1971. 	S11E9.4
rick, marty, and the team unearthed a mysterious feature at smith\'s cove that was originally discovered by dan blankenship in 1971. you got a roman numeral? yeah. if it is, it\'s a 7v11. a nearly 65-foot-long, u-shaped wooden structure that was believed to be associated with the flood tunnels connected to the money pit. it not only featured large wooden dowels, but was also engraved with a unique style of roman numerals. it looks like the i-i-i-i. roman numerals that also match those found on an ancient musket artifact that was discovered six weeks ago in the circular depression on lot 5. 	S11E9.4
match those found on an ancient musket artifact that was discovered six weeks ago in the circular depression on lot 5. here, there\'s some, like it was cut. yeah. just put it aside. we\'ll wash it. is it possible the oak island team has found evidence of a related wooden structure near the stone road in the swamp? if so, could it be a critical piece of evidence that might help complete the oak island puzzle? hopefully, there\'s more. we\'ll bag this up? yeah. the u-shaped structure is one of the most mysterious things we found on the island. finding another wooden construction using the same technique here in the swamp speaks to the extent of the works on oak island. 	S11E9.4
another wooden construction using the same technique here in the swamp speaks to the extent of the works on oak island. nope, not getting any of it. nothing. how much deeper before we get to the level of the stone road? let\'s say it\'s another foot. yeah. well, we\'re certainly coming in the zone that we start to look for it more and more, yeah. ok, let\'s keep digging. all right. ok, i\'ll get out of the way. yeah. as the investigation of the swamp continues. i\'d like to see it stop completely. obviously, you guys would do. yeah. do you feel the flow has slowed down any? 	S11E9.4
obviously, you guys would do. yeah. do you feel the flow has slowed down any? it seems that way. in the money pit area, scott barlow, along with paul cote of dumas contracting limited, have descended some 87 feet to the bottom of the garden shaft in order to assess the progress of their efforts to stop the mysterious inflow of water currently flooding the structure. one of the problems also is the water accumulating overnight while we\'re not here. yes. and then water rising 50 points deep and then getting the pump down. if we start digging deeper right now, we just create a bigger point. 	S11E9.4
if we start digging deeper right now, we just create a bigger point. if we don\'t fix the problem now. yeah. it has been quite some time, and we really haven\'t made any progress in that shaft. this is one of the main focuses of our efforts this summer, so i\'m a little concerned. on the other hand, i am still very confident that dumas can stop the water, at least control it. we just need to control the water as much as we can. yeah. we\'re going to continue to fill these massive voids with this urethane foam. we need to get to the bottom of the garden shaft and find the treasure that\'s supposedly here. 	S11E9.4
we need to get to the bottom of the garden shaft and find the treasure that\'s supposedly here. and then let\'s see what happens. and we\'ll just try to keep moving forward, i guess. let\'s go up and make some calls, ok? meanwhile. wow. holy cow, that\'s huge. across the island on lot 5. it\'s massive. the structure is massive. 30 to 40 feet, like, wow. jack begley joins other members of the team who have just made a surface outline of the buried foundation that was identified beneath the circular depression during a recent magnetometry survey. this is way bigger than any other foundation on the island. 	S11E9.4
this is way bigger than any other foundation on the island. and who knows what other things are going to lie just in between the rocks to really tell us, is this phipps related? we don\'t know yet. but i find it to be really hopeful. but it\'s going to take a long time. it would have been a lot of work just to fill it in. but it\'s going to be a lot of work just to dig it back out. and we know, at least, it was not surveyed in 1762, which makes me believe that it was not visible in 1762. 	S11E9.4
we know, at least, it was not surveyed in 1762, which makes me believe that it was not visible in 1762. but had already been previously constructed and then torn down. yeah, pre-morris. yeah. i really think it was intentionally hidden. yeah. and it\'s for that reason that i think it\'s tied directly to the money pit. wow. yeah, when you said 30 by 45 feet. yeah. i knew how big that was, but to see it taped down, it\'s a whole different story. absolutely. all right, well, i guess let\'s get back to work, because we got a lot to do. 	S11E9.4
absolutely. all right, well, i guess let\'s get back to work, because we got a lot to do. yeah, let\'s get back to work. the fact that someone came and filled this area in with boulders and tried to cover it up makes you really wonder, like, was it phipps? and why has it remained hidden for so long? that\'s weird. what\'s up? hmm. i mean, there\'s a line on it, but that\'s natural, right? like, that\'s rock. it\'s not pottery. it\'s definitely not natural. there\'s more on this side. oh. so definitely that was engraved. oh. why would they decorate both sides? 	S11E9.4
s11e9.5 we found something amazing. really? yeah. i\'d like you to have a look at it and give me your opinion. after being alerted to the discovery of a mysterious stone artifact in the foundation beneath the circular depression on lot 5... this is nothing like anything we\'ve been finding here at all. rick lagina arrives to personally examine it. this is man-made. absolutely. and the strange thing for me is that it\'s carved on both sides, and the edges are clearly, you know, rounded to that figuration. yeah. we\'re still scratching our heads on that. yeah, absolutely. a carved stone found in the buried foundation on lot 5? 	S11E9.5
we\'re still scratching our heads on that. yeah, absolutely. a carved stone found in the buried foundation on lot 5? could it be related to the numerous metal tools that have been directly linked to sir william phipps? and if so, might it be an important clue that will help explain how this buried structure may be connected to the oak island mystery? so just catch me up. this outline you have, this is the magnetometer work that was done? yes. we\'ve marked the corners of what looks like the large rectangular structure. and so it doesn\'t look like you would expect a stacked wall to look like. 	S11E9.5
and so it doesn\'t look like you would expect a stacked wall to look like. so what we think is that whoever built it, they decided to hide it and collapsed it on itself and then buried it. really? yeah. i think that we can definitely say that this feature and the small rectangular feature up there were both intentionally buried. wow. oh, and the artifacts that we\'ve found from just digging down to this depth, and they speak to when this entire structure was buried and covered over. yes. and that\'s still pre-money pit discovery. yes. and we\'re not even to the base floor yet. 	S11E9.5
yes. and that\'s still pre-money pit discovery. yes. and we\'re not even to the base floor yet. there\'s been some interesting hypotheticals associated with the construct that might help explain it. i think the connection of sir william phipps to the lot 5 feature certainly is possible if this is a privateer\'s location, but it does not say definitively, here\'s your answer. i don\'t think we have that yet. everyone\'s excited to get down to that final depth where we can get a real good idea on when this structure was in use. well, congratulations for what you\'ve done. this is quite impressive. 	S11E9.5
well, congratulations for what you\'ve done. this is quite impressive. it may turn history on its ear, and that\'s pretty cool. yeah. ok, congrats. good luck. thanks. see you, rick. while operations continue on lot 5 and in the money pit area, hey. hey. anything? just finishing up the first day area. rick lagina joins his nephew alex, metal detection expert gary drayton, and billy gerhardt as they continue excavating near the stone road in the southeast corner of the swamp. billy. when you poke with your teeth, it seems like there\'s rocks underneath. so i\'m not really sure. we might want to do a little hand digging there. 	S11E9.5
so i\'m not really sure. we might want to do a little hand digging there. alex and i can do that. gary needs a digger. one of us can hop up. we\'ll do that then. that\'s a plan. keep this guy busy. i\'m trying. i think anywhere is right in there, yeah? even where your feet are. it has to be in here. it is definitely rockier there. you might want to give steve a call and just give me an idea of the relationship between that depth and the stone road right there. i\'ll dig it down and just see what happens. 	S11E9.5
s11e9.6 in the triangle-shaped swamp. what is that? that is some kind of chain. yeah. rick lagina and members of the oak island team have just made a potentially important discovery. that has potential to be old, i think. yeah. yeah. it looks old. you can see it. it looks like it\'s hand-forged. yeah. my guess is pre-1840s. oh, wow. well, it\'s the big piece on the end. could be a hook. yeah, either a hook or just a big link. yeah. and you\'d need a chain like this for, hopefully, unloading. right. i\'m not going to say loading. unloading. because we are looking for treasure. 	S11E9.6
right. i\'m not going to say loading. unloading. because we are looking for treasure. i like it. a hand-forged iron chain found near the potentially 500-year-old stone road? could gary be correct that it may have been used to unload valuable cargo from a ship and onto oak island long ago? okay, mate, i\'ll recheck the pile, see if we get any more finds. okay. we have got something else in here. oh, look at that oak. we got an oak. that looks like an oldie. that\'s like a crude oak. we hope that emma can say how old that is. 	S11E9.6
that looks like an oldie. that\'s like a crude oak. we hope that emma can say how old that is. yeah, and so this might be a sign of great things to come, because whatever they was all in this chain broke, and it might still be in the dig. let\'s keep our fingers crossed and keep looking. ok, mate. we found some really good artifacts that speaks to moving some very heavy things in this area. and it also speaks to the amount of work that was being done in the island. of course, i would hope that maybe this is related to the oak island mystery. 	S11E9.6
of course, i would hope that maybe this is related to the oak island mystery. little blippy blop, but nothing big. i\'ll put this to one side. yeah. okey-doke. anyway, so i think you\'re right. if it extends, it\'s got to come through here. hey, steve. hey, rick. we\'re trying to figure out if the road pushes out further, right? yep. but in order to figure out where we lay in relationship to that, you need to tell me where we are at the top of that stone. i can do that. in order to help determine if they have indeed found a new section of the stone road, surveyor steve guptill is using his topcon hyper 2 gps receiver to measure and compare the elevation of the newly uncovered stone structure with that of the stone road. 	S11E9.6
2 gps receiver to measure and compare the elevation of the newly uncovered stone structure with that of the stone road. all right, so the elevation here actually works, rick. so we have a 2% slope, the highest point being closest to land, sloping southward, decreasing towards the ocean. so the slope would work here. if that has anything to do with the stone road. that\'s right. but is it related? we\'d have to dig some more. yeah. well, the other thing, too, is you can see this flare. yep. why the flare? i don\'t know. my thought is you have a wagon or an oxen come down there, and this is a turnaround. 	S11E9.6
my thought is you have a wagon or an oxen come down there, and this is a turnaround. yep. if oxen were used to offload a ship or pull heavy loads, they would have to turn around, thus the need for the flare in the road. this shows that there was a tremendous amount of work done on the island, perhaps to conceal and hide something. so bill, pull that back a little bit, if you would, see if we see anything else. right. and then keep gary busy. all right. there are no answers till you start digging. that\'s right.
